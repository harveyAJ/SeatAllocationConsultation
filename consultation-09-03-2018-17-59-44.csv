Graham Bishop,graham@penllyn.plus.com,Within the last month,2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,We did sit together,£5 - £9.99,"Situation was not taken up with airline. Having booked via Broadway Travel and we didn't take priority boarding, so were told to check in 4 days before both out and return flights, which were 3 days apart. On checking for the first flight, the system asked if we wanted to book seats or take random allocated seating. Having flown Easyjet many times we have not booked sets but have always been allocated seats together, so expected similar with Ryanair.  When the boarding passes came through I was in row 15 and my wife in 10 which made us quite upset as my wife is a nervous passenger, so when booking the return flight we paid extra to sit together.  When doing this a highlighted pop up statement said ""we note you are sitting apart on the outgoing flight"" this offered us the option to change seats "" Cost From £2"" I was amazed to find that the seat next to me was available but at £8, which we took. It is very clear that Ryanair's system deliberately seated us apart even though 3 days later the seat next to me was not taken.

The 3 seats we could book for free were the furthest apart possible despite there clearly being rows of 3 seats together. I tried a second time and again the seats were far apart but in different locations to the previous allocation, despite it being very clear I was travelling as a single adult with 2 children aged 13.

My daughter who is 18 was placed in an aisle seat on the same row but the opposite side of the aisle.  I was booked in to a seat in row 16.

When we boarded the plane, there was still a single seat left in the block of three where my wife was sitting (as well as other free seats on the plane).  The gentleman who was sitting next to my wife swapped seats with my daughter and I moved from my seat to sit with my family.  

On the return flight my wife and daughter both had aisle seats (row 4 and row 5) whereas I was placed in row 33.  When I booked there were two seats available in one block of three and one aisle on the same row in the other block of three seats.  We could only have booked them if we paid for them.

The minimum amount it would have cost for us to book three seats together was £16 each way.  In addition, when on the flight people were told not to move seats (to sit next to family and friends) as the seating allocation was based on weight (which is a nonsense at an individual passenger level).

Ryanair are using their ""random"" seat allocation as means to gouge passengers for more money.  All low cost airlines are looking to achieve this either by trying to get you to pay for your seat or, like easyjet, by trying to force you to pay extra to take your carryon baggage in to the cabin despite pushing customers to forego putting  baggage in the hold.

When I looked at the seating plan online at the time of checking in there were about 90% of seats still available yet we were allocated on different rows. Once we boarded the plane it was still about 25% empty  so no need for us to have been separated. Definitely felt that they were trying to get us to pay the extra for selecting seats despite being lots of room. Glad we did not pay the extra. 
Also for this flight they were trying to get people to put their carry on into the hold yet there was room on the flight meaning there  was space in the seats and the overhead lockers.

Carol Bull,carolbull@ntlworld.com,Within the last month,2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",TUI Airways (previously Thomson Airways),,We wanted to sit together but it was too expensive to pay extra to do so,£30 or more,"I waited to check in on Thursday 1 February 2018 at 11.40 - the earliest time possible for our flight no. TOM 94 on the 8/2/18 at 11.40 to Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) and although I had checked the previous day, there were 6 pairs of seats remaining together, and several separate seats on the ends, that wouldn't have been too far apart.  When I checked in on the dot, there appeared to be only 2 remaining seats which they had allocated to us, which left me no option but to confirm and take them - they are seat numbers 18F and 16 C, which are not anywhere close to each other, but over on the next isle.  I then went to the return flights and there were still several pairs of seats remaining, but despite this, they offered seats apart still, so as I preferred to be sitting together on a long flight, I had no choice but to move my seat next to my husband's costing £15.50 - which wasn't as bad as having to pay £68 extra to pre-book both of our seats to ensure that we sat together each way.  When I have used Easy Jet on many occasions for short flights, they have always automatically selected seats to sit us together, even though I did not select seats and pay the extra, there was only 1 occasion when this did not happen, but they at least put us at the end of the isle on both sides, so still effectively near each other.  Although I realise that this is a chance that you take when you choose not to pay the extra (which I firmly believe is just another money making  scheme of theirs!), I do think that if seats are still available together when you wait to check-in, then it is obvious that you are travelling together and would prefer to sit together, but they have gone out of their way to sit us apart purposefully in order to gain extra money!  I really do not know why (other than wishing to pay for extra leg room, or upgraded or specific seating) why you are not automatically allocated seats at the time of booking on a first come basis.  I really feel this is just a total unhelpful money making scheme of TUI's to purposefully sit you apart when there are in fact still unallocated seats available.  I really appreciate that you are now looking into this situation - airlines should be far more helpful to passengers, after all we have a choice, I definitely feel I will think twice now before booking with them again.",2018-02-03 18:16:06,ANON-VXSB-EZDT-T,"82.33.120.234,127.0.0.1",2018-02-03 17:50:46,v3.6.0-v3-frontend,open,"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/64.0.3282.140 Safari/537.36",2018-02-03 18:16:10,Introduction,Airline seating allocations

We checked in as soon as the free check-in was available and were allocated one seat at the front of the plane and one in the middle with additional leg-room. I could see on check-in that the seats around both those seats were free but we would have to pay extra to choose seats together. When we arrived at the gate, other passengers around us were joking about how they were not sat with their partners. This was during term time, so most of the flight was couples. 

When boarding the plane, the rows surrounding me at the front of the plane was made up of split-up couples. They talked and all moved around to sit with their partners. I moved mid flight to sit with my partner in the still empty seat with extra legroom. 

As passengers were moving, Ryanair staff made an announcement to ask that passengers remain in their allocated seats as they had been allocated in order to have the correct weight distribution across the plane. How would they know this without asking our weight/height at check-in?! It was obvious to all that they had purposely split-up passengers under the same booking in order to make financial gains.

Despite indications otherwise, I could not access paid seat selection at all for my flights at any time after booking my flights several months in advance. It seemed that, by using a codeshare flight, I could not access any of these seat selections.

During the check-in period for this trip, I noticed that my partner and I were allocated seats approximately 15-20 rows apart from one another for the Emirates flight. This was odd, as I managed to find and switch to two seats, with one behind the other on an adjacent row.  

I still could not access seat selection through Qantas for the next leg, but, by using Qantas' iOS app, I was able to find that once again we were seated several rows part. Incidentally, their website only displayed seat choices (aisle/window/no preference), not the seat allocations themselves.

I called Emirates to resolve this issue. However, the Customer Services representative couldn’t do anything to resolve the seat selections on the Emirates leg. She did however offer to put us together if we were willing to pay over £140 for two exit row seats. I complained that, having spent over £1000 for the flights already, it was unreasonable for us to be charged more than 10% extra for such a long flight. In the end, she left a note on the system that we’d prefer to be sat together, and told us just to go to the airport early. She could do nothing about the seat selection on the Qantas leg.

I called Qantas to try and rearrange the seats, but they were locked out of my booking, presumably by Emirates, and could not even see which seats I’d been assigned. As such, they could do nothing but suggest going to the airport early again.

Frustratingly, I reached out to Emirates Customer Support with a public tweet on their Twitter account (@EmiratesSupport) at 16:09 on 12 January. I received a reply by 09:20 on 13 January asking me to send them details in a private message. By 14:49 the same day, they had allocated me two seats next to one another on the Emirates flight. I could not understand why they did not do this in the first place, or why their representative had not done so over the phone.

I then arrived at the airport 6 hours early to check-in, but again Emirates said they could do nothing about the Qantas flight until I arrived in Dubai, and discussed it with the local Qantas team. However, I went straight to the Qantas desk at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport, and they allocated me seats next to one another straight away.

The entire process was frankly costly and frustrating, and there was no need for such poor Customer Service from mainly Emirates.

There is no doubt that Ryanair deliberately allocate seats apart for people travelling together, so that at least one person has to pay to move next to their fellow passenger(s).

Twice on recent flights, my wife and I, on the same booking, have been allocated seats apart on checking in online. In each case there was an empty seat next to both of us, which means they could have seated us together, but one of us had to pay to move!

Easyjet and Jet2 does not do this and in my experience will seat passengers together subject to availability.

On boarding the plane the Con became very clear as the plane was half empty.  I had an empty seat next to me!  The lady two seats from me was travelling with her husband and they had also been deliberately split up and he was 10 rows away also sitting next to empty seats. 

I subsequently travelled Nimes to Liverpool in August with Ryan air and they again deliberately split my family up including my 14 year old son who had to sit 10 rows away on his own.   Again there were empty seats on the plane this is clearly a deliberate con.

I suspected it was the case but last year on a flight home from Tenerife, the online check in opened, within hours I went on to check in. Me and my son were sat together as he was on my lap as he was under two, yet the other two members of the party were seated at the other end of the plane despite clearly being able to see there were seats together available and empty seats next to me. I checked in (with us all scattered over the plane) and immediately called Ryanair to request to be seated together and explained I could see the seats next to me were empty. Ryanair confirmed that they could only seat the party together if we paid the charge. I explained again the seats were empty and the customer service person could just swap them. He explained he could but only if we paid as this was the policy. I had no option to pay to have us seated together.

This year we are flying with Jet2 and now we have a newborn and 2 year old and have paid an extra £60 to be seated together as we want to sit as a family. I think airlines should seat parties together prioritising individuals with minors. It wouldn't really bother me if I wasn't seated next to adults if I checked in late or made a late booking but I think it's different with minors. In my opinion it's a way if making money.

It's disgraceful.

It seemed petty, if not a form of 'punishment' not to seat us together when we booked in given there was clearly loads of room to do this.

The flight attendant stated that no one should move seats as the 'aircraft is balanced with the current seating arrangement', of course we  ignored him and moved to sit together. 

It was a similar picture on the return flight when the flight was even quieter, again we were allocated seats well apart, once again we moved.

Hopefully intervention can bring some sense to this farcical situation.

Advance online check-in is required up to 60 days prior to flights which we have done registering our passports etc and see no sense in having to go through the process twice to get our boarding passes.

Today, 04/02/2018 we reserved our seats and they have split us up in different rows.

We feel this is a deliberate policy followed by these airlines in order to push up the cost of air travel so why do they not adjust fares so that everyone is treated equally?

It is unfair, unjust and down right ripping of the public who should know the cost of of their travel arrangements upfront and more importantly be able to get their boarding passes when they confirm the booking.

To us this appears to be a perverse case of ""Denied Boarding"" between 5 and 60 days before we fly and discriminates against passengers who want to be assured that their seats are secured on the flights we have booked.

Is there nothing in the regulations that puts the passengers first irrespective of status and financial constraints in the way of obtaining boarding passes?

Jeremy Harber,jraharber@compuserve.com,"More than 3 months ago, but within the last 6 months",2,0,0,0,"Yes, I/they did",British Airways (BA),,None of these,Not Answered,"Please see below for the complaint email to BA. Their response was disgracefully dismissive. Their focus is on making profit by not seating families together without paying for it.

I'm writing to complain about our flight last night from Granada, Spain to London City Airport. The flight itself was delayed by at least one hour and twenty minutes, for reasons that weren't explained to anyone, but that isn't the main reason for our complaint. 

We were also unable to check in online beforehand, though again, that isn't the main reason for our complaint. Just a mild irritant compared to the experience you then served up for us.

The primary reason for our complaint is the scandalous approach you apparently have to seating. We had booked return flights from London City to Granada in business class, mainly because the standard of your economy class service (especially from LHR/LGW) is now so bad I may as well fly Ryanair for better service at lower cost. 

For context, my wife is an extremely nervous flyer and the tickets were booked together at a cost of over £350 each.

On arrival at Granada Airport we dropped our bags at the check-in desk only to notice that we had been given separate seats, 2A and 3A. The check in agent was of no help, providing a fantastic reenactment of the ""Computer says no"" sketch from Little Britain. 

This was completely unacceptable on so many levels, but let me spell some of them out for you:

1. We had booked the trip with two tickets on one booking as a married couple, so why would you choose to split the seats up? Completely unacceptable.

2. There were a number of solo travellers in business class and you had chosen to split a married couple across 2A and 3A and put two solo travellers into 2B and 3B. Just what logic or justification is there for that? Again, completely unacceptable.

3. This is business class. It isn't economy, where no doubt you'd come up with some pathetic policy based excuses about seats not being guaranteed etc. However, for the amount we had paid: completely unacceptable.

4. Paid-for seat reservations should be used when a passenger fancies being nearer the front of the plane for example and is happy to pay extra to secure this. We shouldn't need to pay for seat reservations to ensure two married individuals sit together on a flight they've booked together. Completely unacceptable.

Whilst we're on the subject, please let your value-destroying Chief Executive know that trying to charge passengers in business class crazy amounts to pre-book seats is tantamount to a budget airline. Is this really British Airways? (""To fly, to rip passengers off at every possible turn""? I digress again.)

My wife is an extremely nervous flyer, so had we stuck with our allocated seats and sat separately, then we would have had to walk off the flight. On boarding the aircraft we asked the lead stewardess what could be done, with my wife terrified, and helpfully she spoke to passengers in 2B and 3B asking them if they could switch seats. Reluctantly one agreed. 

However, we were made to look and feel like the awkward disruptive passengers causing delays and chaos on an already heavily delayed flight. I do not pay you £350 per ticket to be treated like a pariah in business class because of a problem entirely of your own making.

My wife's anxiety levels are already sky high before a flight and I'd therefore like to understand why you think it is permissible for you to utterly demolish any relaxation achieved whilst on holiday and cause so much additional damage to my wife's health as a result of your incompetence. She was extremely upset and panicked during the delay and throughout the flight, heightened because she thought she may have to sit alone.

In light of this, what I'm not expecting in response is a ridiculous boilerplate customer service response. I'm also not interested in hearing (as I do so regularly in the press) about how your chief executive apparently isn't running a once good airline into the dust through his own quest for cost savings at the expense of quality of service.

I want to understand, in a format you'd be comfortable being shared on BBC Watchdog, Which magazine and the like, as to why you think it is appropriate to split married couples up on a flight for no justifiable reason whatsoever. I'm then interested in what you're going to do about the huge anxiety, anguish and stress caused, so I can explain to my wife that of course you do have her health and safety interests and quality customer service at the forefront of your approach. Whilst I don't want to use BA at all, my wife seems to like you. Hard to fathom, I know.

In the interests of balance, the stewardess on board was helpful and the crew did their best to sort things out. No thanks to the corporate policies, systems and processes that you've designed to ""serve"" your passengers. Sometimes I'd hope your corporate vision would actually translate into  something meaningful rather than being words on a website (that your value-destroying Chief Executive can hide behind).

The civil aviation authority are having an investigation into airlines deliberately seating customers apart to make them pay for seats. They are after feedback. If you fancy helping them challenge Ryan Air, the link is at the bottom and the text below is what I sent - you could perhaps rephrase it a bit but keep the message...

""There appears to be a very clear policy by Ryan air, brought in during the last few months to deliberately seat couples and groups apart unless they are prepared to pay extra. This has happen to me several times over the last 2 years  but never previously.  We have seen parents with young children a allocated  separate seats.

In practice, many people get up and select new seats amongst themselves, which seems stressful, unsafe and unnecessary. It's clearly happening to everyone who flies Ryan air, and I urge you to try and reverse this unpleasant money grabbing trend.""",2018-02-04 15:18:38,ANON-VXSB-EZX2-C,"82.19.236.233,127.0.0.1",2018-02-04 15:11:51,v3.6.0-v3-frontend,open,"Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 5.1.1; A0001 Build/LMY48B) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/64.0.3282.137 Mobile Safari/537.36",2018-02-04 15:18:49,Introduction,Airline seating allocations

Many people with my condition are unable to fly. However if I manage it carefully, I am able to fly. 
I have orthostatic hypotension-even when seated my blood pressure can drop-elevating my legs (if necessary putting my knees on my husband's lap or against the side wall of the plane) resolves the problem. If I cannot do this, I  develop dizziness, headaches, difficulty in thinking, sweating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
On longer flights (eg over 2 hours), the slipped/fused discs in my neck cause severe pain. Again, resting  and supporting my head and neck against the side wall of the plane makes an enormous difference to my pain levels.
To manage this I request a window seat (anywhere on the plane-I don't mind) with my husband next to me. I am usually asked to pay significant sums of money for both of us to ensure a wall/window seat. When I explain my disability, the airlines are generally uninterested and say they can only support people who are deaf/blind or in a wheelchair, and if I need assistance with my medical problems I must pay the supplements. On one occasion, travelling to the USA  they quoted me around £340 return extra -this was just for one leg of the flight each way in economy class-had we reserved a seat on each leg of the journey it would have been much more. 
Only occasionally are airlines sympathetic to this problem and will allocate me a seat window/wall seat .

On boarding the plane we found there were spare seats in the rows we were allocated so could easily have been allocated seats together.  There were many other passengers in the same position on our flight so after take off there was a mass swapping of seats.
I said to my wife at the time I suspected this was deliberate in order to encourage paying the extra for seats up front.

I always book our flights and check in online and until May 2017 whenever I did so we were always allocated 2 seats next to each other. We never paid extra for it. Then, when we travelled in May 2017 we were allocated 10B and 30E, 2 middle seats, 20 rows apart. I went to the section of the site to choose seats and at the time 10A and 10C were both available so we could have been allocated 2 seats next to each other. We didn't pay, we just sat apart. Now, every time we fly, if we don't pay for specific seats, where we sit depends on how close to the flight time that we check in. If we check in as early as we can we get 2 middle seats separated. If we check in as late as possible we end up in either an aisle seat or a window seat as all the middle seats have been allocated. Every flight now starts with passengers trying to negotiate with each other so that they can sit with their friends or family and that again causes delays, frustration and in some cases anger. Our feeling is that if making money is the issue, Ryanair should simply charge £5 more per seat and allocate groups of seats together. Nobody would complain about that.

Mr Leigh Lewis,leighwlewis@yahoo.com,Within the last month,2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",British Airways (BA),,We did sit together,Not Answered,"As part of a British Airways holiday my wife and I had booked two business class seats to Tel Aviv on a flight leaving on 15 January.  As a 'Bronze' Executive Club member I am entitled to reserve seats on BA flights without charge a week before departure. When I sought to do so, however, I was astonished to find that my wife and I had been allocated entirely separate seats in different rows of the cabin. According to the BA system there were no other seats available.

When I eventually managed to make contact by phone with a BA member of staff I said that this was highly unsatisfactory and  explained that my wife and I are in our late 60s and absolutely did not want to be seated apart on a 5 hour flight. The member of staff, while polite, said that there was absolutely nothing that she could do. Her only suggestion was that we try to get our seats reallocated at check in at the airport. All attempts to speak to a more senior BA person proved fruitless.

We did in the end manage to sit together after explaining the position at check in but the whole experience was a very stressful one which took much of the gloss off what was meant to be a very special holiday. I think it quite bizarre that we were not allocated seats together at the outset given that we had made a single booking with identical surnames from which it would have been self-evident that we were a couple.

On a previous flight with Ryanair the same thing happened, and after the flight it turned out that the people we sat next to were a couple that were also separated from each other.
On the most recent flight, I was moved to an emergency exit window seat because someone had 'stolen' seat elsewhere and passengers were shuffled around. Whilst sitting there, I imagined exiting the plane in an emergency and thinking about waiting on the wing for my wife to come through, torn between her safety and the safety of other passengers. Irresponsible thoughts, I know.
As it turned out, the plane performed two go arounds at MAN before being diverted to BHX due to strong winds. I later learned that she genuinely thought she was going to die. Feeling guilty about not paying the extra to sit with her now.

No doubt Ryanair will be secretly updating their backend seat allocation code and we'll magically see true random seat allocations.

Ryanair make announcements over the tannoy when people do this, telling people that they must sit in their allocated seat.

I find the ambiguity as to when you can and can't sit together, depending upon whether you pay, infuriating.

I also think that there is a safety issue. What if there was a problem on the plane? Loved ones would be wanting to rush up and down the aisles to be with each other.

When I travel on BA, I consistently choose to sit in an aisle seat. Obviously, BA knows this from its records. EVERY time they automatically allocate me a seat, they give me a window seat. Without fail.

Now this COULD be because more people like window seats than like aisle seats. But it could also be because they know I prefer aisle seats and am therefore more likely to pay to move seats if allocated a window seat.

I urge you to ask them, and other airlines, if such practices go on.

I had heard that children under 12 should always be seated with a parent.  Is this not true?  You have to give the ages of children when you book, so it is not a case of not knowing his age.  I was prepared (although dreading) having to sit separately from my husband, but had assumed that one of us would be able to sit with our son.  There were also plenty of spare seats on the plane - and in fact the very nice cabin crew sorted us a row where we could all sit together, without having to move anyone.

Cathal Lorigan,cathal.lorigan@gmail.com,"More than 6 months ago, but within the last 12 months",2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,We did sit together,£5 - £9.99,"-My email to Ryanair (12/7/17):

Hi,

I'm just wondering why I can book flights for 2 people but unless I pay extra for allocated seating, Ryanair's algorithm will ensure that we're seated as far apart as possible.

I really thought you'd moved past the price gouging in recent years. While price is one of the main factors I consider when choosing a flight, this just feels remarkably petty after I'd paid £360 for flights.

-Their response on 13/7/17:
We refer to your online enquiry dated 12th July 2017.

Please be advised that is customer’s choice to pay or not for a seat. We are not trying to force people to pay for reserved seats. We are very happy to facilitate any customer who wants a free of charge random seat but we are also going to do our best to facilitate customers who are willing to pay for a reserved seat (usually window or aisle) which start from £2.

We trust that the above has been of assistance.

-My response on 13/7/17:
Thank you for the prompt reply. 

As I noted in my email, it's entirely your decision how much you charge and the extras that you charge for. I haven't come across any other airline that ""randomly"" allocates middle seats at opposite ends of the plane when you check in 3 days before the flight but maybe I've just been lucky.

As I've also noted in my email, I will factor this additional cost of £15-20 into any price comparisons with other airlines. I've checked my return flight from Dublin and it will cost £4 per seat. My next flight with Ryanair is in August and it's going to cost me £3.75 per seat each way.

While you clearly don't agree, this is a stealth charge, similar to your mark up on credit card payment fees and the previous tactic of automatically charging for extras (eg. insurance) unless it was unselected.

Their response on 26/7/17:
We refer to your online enquiry dated 13th July 2017.

Whilst we sympathise with your view, we regret that our position as set out in the letter dated 13/07/2017 remains unaltered.

Sarah Morgan,sarahlake81@hotmail.com,Within the last month,4,,1,,"No, I/they didn’t",TUI Airways (previously Thomson Airways),,We did sit together,£30 or more,"Travelling with a 4 year old we are always nervous that we would be separated on flights as we travel quiet regularly and have seen cabin crew asking passengers once seated if they would move to allow a parent to sit with a child. Having a young child sat on their own with strangers maybe 1 row in front is just not good enough. 

We recently paid £50pp to sit together on a long haul flight which is totally unreasonable but again on long haul you do want to be separated so the airlines have you over a barrel. We contacted the travel company to be told tough basically pay it or risk not to be seated together. 

A great idea that other airlines should adopt are that if you are travelling with young children then your seat with theirs are allocated together and if other party members wish to sit with you they can pay which I find is acceptable. Not to charge a family with young children a fee to be sat next to each other.

We always made sure that we checked in online 4 days prior to departure (previously 2 weeks) and until May 2017 would always be allocated seats together.

On 4 May 2017 we flew with Ryanair from Manchester to Lanzarote.  We had checked in online on 30 April and we're seated together.  However, when we came to check-in online 4 days prior to our return flight on 25 May, we we're seated at different ends of the plane.  It is our belief that during our visit to Lanzarote, Ryanair's online check-in software was reprogrammed to deliberately seat us apart.

We flew with Ryanair again in September/October 2017  and we're seated at opposite ends of the plane on both the outbound and inbound flights.  After checking in online for both flights, a screen appeared offering the opportunity for us to pay extra to sit together.

We've since booked flights for September/October 2018 with Ryanair and during the booking process were prompted to pay additional fees to sit together.

I am convinced that Ryanair's booking software has an algorithm built in to deliberately seat groups apart then offer them the chance to pay additional fees to sit together.",2018-02-05 15:10:36,ANON-VXSB-EZKM-T,"103.48.205.201,127.0.0.1",2018-02-05 14:50:59,v3.6.0-v3-frontend,open,"Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0; Moto G (5) Build/NPP25.137-15) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/64.0.3282.137 Mobile Safari/537.36",2018-02-05 15:10:51,Introduction,Airline seating allocations

We treated ourselves to Business Class flights. We knew we could pay to get allocated seats, but at £67 each were reluctant to do so, and we could not believe that BA would split up a family in Business Class. But it did - allocating 3 different seats in 3 separate rows. The system would not allow me to check in online the day before either, potentially choosing seats free at that point. Our travel agent rang BA but it said it couldn't do anything to get us sitting together. At LHR the check in desk couldn't do anything either except call the back office to try before we boarded. The woman at the gate was apologetic but also could do nothing. She did however say ""since the new system came in none of us have been able to do changes like we could before"". The chief steward on the plane said it was ""outrageous"" that a family wasn't seated together.  But he spent 5 minutes reorganising people and got 2 of us sitting together at least. I suppose once all seats are ""buyable"" there is not much scope left for the airline managing allocations after lots are bought. Assignments would have to be fixed before opening the rest for sale.  BA staff were very sympathetic, but had no means of helping compensate for ""the system"". We will now avoid flying BA whenever possible, and tell everyone it is now a budget airline of the worst kind even for premium travellers.

My experience is that airlines actively make sure we have to sit apart if we don't pay the extra to sit together.  The last time this happened we booked a Tui holiday to Fuerteventura, with a Thomas Cook flight, which Thomas Cook subbed out to an airline we had never heard of.  As a result the on-line booking facility was confusing / not available so we didn't book seats.
At check in we asked for seats together and were told there were none, and that we would have to be across the aisle, but were then told even this wasn't possible. We asked to pay to 'upgrade' to sit together but told we couldn't.
Airlines take booking and money months in advance. It is diabolical to charge that airlines charge extra to sit next to a travelling companion. They would be better offering a reduction to those those who are nor bothered. 
My wife is adamant airlines make sure you are split up if you don't pay, and I now agree.
Once we were split up when there was two complete sets of 3 seats free.
Another time we were split on the outbound, but it was no problem to sit together on the inbound

We paid for 1x adult per 1 under 12. But still, we encountered issues with the allocated seats. 
Their system put an under 18 teenager in a seat near the emergency exit, both legs of our travel. And there was complete chaos when some other passengers are actually sitting where our group with children were suppose to seat. Stewards and stewardess were obviously pressured and having a hard time re arranging seats. 

Definitely  we feel that RyanAir, as though information were available, consciously made their system in a way that will make their passengers have 2nd thoughts of booking and paying for a confirmed seat.

Disappointing is an understatement and we welcome this investigation by the government.

Usually this is glasgow to Dublin and return, to visit family. We have flown this route on a regular basis for the last few years. We have also flown other routes.
Prior to he introduction of charges for choosing seats together we found that we were pretty well always seated together. Since the introduction of charges we have never been together, even when there has been an empty seat next to one of us, or when the plane ( recently) had only 90 passengers.  
If you opt not to pay to choose a seat you are nearly always allocated a middle seat, even when others are available 
I cannot believe that the random allocation ( as claimed by Ryanair) has produced such different results since the introduction of charges!

When I made the booking the sales advisor indicated that there were six seats available together outward and return, and did I want to pay extra to reserve these seats ?
I asked why I was required to pay this supplement as the seats were unreserved at the time of booking.
The reply was to the effect that this was the procedure to guarantee seats together. I again asked why unreserved could not be allocated at time of booking free of charge and received a similar answer. 
I declined to pay more and escalated the issue by email to Stephen Heapy CEO of Jet2.
He delegated one of his staff to answer and I posed the same question and again received a non commital response.
I rephrasedthe complaint as ""why is there not a first come, first served"" policy - which once more was met by an evasive explanation of the company policy, rather than addressing the substantive point at issue.
In the end Jet2 allocated seats together without further cost as a goodwill gesture.
The following Easter I booked another package holiday for the same party from Jet2 and emailed Stephen Heapy to request another similar complimentary offer, which was forthcoming.
Obviously it pays to challenge policies which are fundementally flawed and morally indefensible.

On another note, when I flew with Virgin I was told that although our son was only 12, he was classed as adult so the only way we could guarantee him being by one of us was to pay to reserve seats. I don't think it is appropriate to let a child sit separately on a long haul flight, especially overnight, so obviously we paid but we didn't feel like there was really a choice in the matter.

We refused the request as we had paid £70 for the privilege of being seated together on a 12 hour flight. Other passengers also refused.
The outcome was that a husband and wife on the same row as us were ordered by the captain to sit apart to accommodate the non paying woman and her child, even though they had paid to sit together.
The captain feared that we would lose our take-off slot if the matter was not resolved immediately. 
The couple were distressed and other passengers disgusted on their behalf.
The couple were given an address to complain to, and complimentary drinks for the inconvenience.

However when I checked in for my flight (FR5994 from London Stansted to Madrid due to depart on 11th November 2017) at 530am on the earliest day I could do so, I found my friend and I were sat at opposite ends of the plane. I could see the plane was literally empty, so why wouldn't Ryanair ordinarily try and sit those customers travelling together next to each other as they have done previously. This change in algorithm appears to have  commenced following the 'pilot holiday saga'.  

I tried to change my partner's seat to join me at the rear of the plane which was cheaper and I was about to pay £4 when the session timed out. When I re-entered the site to amend the seating, I  saw the seats either side of me had all of a sudden been blocked out (no other seats had been blocked out) and I was therefore left having to move myself to a seat at the front of the plane for a more expensive charge of £7. This also happened on the return leg. 

I raised this complaint with Ryanair in three attempts, but each time my complaint wasn't specifically addressed and I was sent a brief generic response  recommending the purchase of seats in advance.

At the earliest check in time possible I checked in and was given 3 middle seats scattered around the plane. You are then asked if you are happy with seats which I was clearly not! You  then see a plan of the plane and the available seats. From this it was clear that there were loads of seats in rows of 3, or closer together that were free. So why were we not seated together? I paid to move 1 of my daughters next to the other and I sat alone. Also when you chose a seat Ryanair they ask you not to book a middle seat!!
 So why were we given 3 unnecessarily? I know why, to make us pay to move.
I am travelling to Ryanair next month . I have not booked any seats so I am guessing the same will happen . I feel very strongly that this is a bad practice. 
I did not report this at the time because I knew the airlane wouldnt respond satisfactorily.

I telephoned customer services and was advised the flight was full and there were no seats together, I felt I had no option but to pay the extra with us being allocated seats some distance apart for a 12 hour flight. I had seen a Watchdog show on this previously and was sceptical of their claim that everyone had already checked in online within 20 minutes, I went onto the TUI website and attempted to book the maximum of 9 seats on the same flight and they were showing as available, so clearly the flight couldn’t have been sold out or full.

We did not report this to the airline as we managed OK.

We have flights for two adults booked later in the year with Tui to Barbados and have had to pay extra £34 per person to guarantee that we will be sat together.  As the flight is a long we feel it necessary.  On shorter routes within europe, we refuse to pay this and have sat apart.     How come airlines like Qatar, BA and schedule airlines can manage allocating seats at the time of booking without charge, never had a problem with these long haul flights.

However, when completing online check in, the day before the flight, our seats had been cancelled and we were given 3 individual seats in various parts of the plane, including our 11 year old daughter sitting alone 10 rows away from her nearest parent. We were unable to change this and had to seek help at the airport. We were told that the plane seat configuration had changed last minute and as we had not paid to sit together our reservations were cancelled. We explained that we had booked when seat reservations were still free but they explained that was merely a request for specific seats and would never have been guaranteed.

The whole thing is a total nonsense in this computer age and if  train companies as bad as Virgin can book a seat when booking , the configuration of a train carriage is similar to a plane. You keep using the word ""CONFUSION"" - no such thing - you are allowing  Airlines to literally fleece the public. The layout of a plane on booking can be viewed on line and there is absolutely no reason to pay for the privilege for a specific seat if available at the time of booking.

Kirsty Jenkins,kirstypennington@hotmail.com,"More than 3 months ago, but within the last 6 months",2,,1,1,"No, I/they didn’t",Jet2.com,,We did sit together,£10 - £14.99,"Prior to flying with Jet2, I raised my concern with the online check in process that I undertook at the earliest opportunity. I had not pre selected seats for our party as I was happy to wait until check in to do this, especially as I could see online that there was sufficient seating on both our outbound and inbound flight (including several rows of 3 seats together). However, at the point of online check in, the system auto allocated seats on separate rows (despite the availability of several groups of 3 seats in a row) and, most concerning, had put my 3 year old daughter in a seat on her own, separate from either myself or my husband. As a result, I was forced to pay the fee (nearly £60 extra in total for both flights) to self select our seats together so my daughter was not sat alone in a different part of the plane. Jet2 (on the phone) explained that the system automatically selects the first seats available from the back of the plane (and therefore does not always seat parties together). While I understand this, the system's lack of sophistication means it is unable to identify the age of its passengers and allocate seats appropriately.

Before the flight, I contacted TUI several times as we wanted to check in online, but not pay for seats. First we were told there was a bug with their website - further research showed this is not the case - then we were told the seats allocated for online checkin were all taken and we needed to check in at the airport. This was a long haul flight. For two adults sitting apart was not so much of an issue, but for a family it could be a problem. We felt TUI had us to ransom over the seats. We didn’t pay the charge as the holiday was well over £2,000 so to be asked to pay a further £80 to sit together was obscene. The airline know some people would pay rather than risk being separated. It’s coldhearted and unfair and spoiled the start of our holiday. I would seriously reconsider flying with TUI again, particularly since they lied about the ‘bug’ with their website - which my research shows has been around for years.

Subject: Seat AllocationsI prefer not to select seats, at an extra charge, when flying with budget airlines. Instead, I check in as soon as the online facility is open but, despite prompt check-in, my wife and I were allocated seats 31f and 32f on our fight ls190 on 28/9/14; this does not particularly bother us as it is a short flight. However,the couple next to me were not related and their partners had been allocated across the aisle; a mother and her infant, next to my wife were separated from the father. After much negotiation and switching families and partners were reunited - except my wife ended up further away from me.

On ls190 on 2nd Oct, my daughter and her husband, Mr & Mrs Bryceland, were near the front of the plane and separated - the odd thing is their rows both had an empty seat! There was also much changing of seats reported by my daughter, although one passenger declined an invitation to move beside her husband, meaning my daughter and son-in-law remained unnecessarily separated.

I suspect Jet2 is deliberately using algorithms to separate passengers in order to persuade them to cough up more money in the future to book seats ahead. I can think of many reasons (from risking take-off slots to body identification) that this is not a proper practice.

Can you confirm that you deliberately split parties up or please explain why this is a common occurrence?

Dear Mr Capon

Thank you for your email received by us on the 10th October 2014.

I was sorry to read that you were disappointed with the seats you were allocated for your recent flights with us to Palma. I understand this it is disappointing to be allocated seats separately from Mrs Capon.

I would like to explain that for customers who choose not to pre-book, seats are allocated in a sequence that starts from the back of the aircraft working forwards. The system will always miss out any seats that are already reserved or that are located within an emergency exit and it is for this reason, we cannot guarantee seats will always be allocated together. We do not want customers to be surprised by this and so we explain how the system works during the booking process.

Nevertheless, I assure you that our system is not designed to intentionally split up customers. If the next available seats in the allocation sequence are adjacent, then customers will find that they have been given seats together, without having to reserve them. However, this cannot be guaranteed and is the reason we do encourage customers to pre-book, for the extra peace of mind.

Once again, thank you for your email and for allowing me the opportunity to explain this for you. I hope that this will not deter you from flying with us again in the future.

Best regards
Sam

You can reallocate your seats to be sitting together, but you need to pay the associated fee to do so.
  
Yours sincerely,

 We moved to row 23 and found that the third seat in the row was actually empty so we could have been put in the same row anyway.

That's fine, except that Ryanair appear to have changed their policy so that if you don't pay extra, then they deliberately seat you far apart - this has happened to me on more than one occasion.  This didn't use to be Ryanair's policy (I've not paid any extra and have ended up sitting next to my partner/friend on more than one occasion)  and it didn't happen on our journey home when, due to ATC problems, our flight was cancelled and we took two flights with Vuelling and one with  Easyjet - we all sat together, or very close together, without paying any extra.  I'm happy with random seating and taking pot luck, what I don't like is the apparent policy of deliberately being seated far apart from my travelling companions.  I think it's potentially dangerous as well - in the event of an emergency or sudden illness, family and friends would naturally want to be near each other so would be moving around the plane trying to swap seats.

The return flight was full and it was very difficult for the flight attendants to move our family so we were sitting close to each other. I also caused anger among other passengers who had paid for their seats and didn't want to move.

Since then, we have had to pay for seat selections which adds a few hundred pounds to our holiday cost.

Laura Hannon,laurahannon@hotmail.co.uk,Within the last month,2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,We wanted to sit together but it was too expensive to pay extra to do so,Not Answered,"I found it frustrating that even though the flights were booked and paid for at the same time and check-in was done simultaneously (as one booking) the 'randomly allocated' seats were 10 rows apart on the outbound flight. They were both in the middle so we couldn't ask to swap (who wants the middle, back row seat?!!).

I investigated paying to sit together on the way out but we had to pay to move both seats, even though there was space next to both of us at the time of booking i.e. we couldn't just pay to move me to sit next to my partner, we would have had to pay £10 each to sit next to each other. When you add this on to the poor service, the fact my bag had to go under my seat because others were larger and they needed the space, I was on the back row, near to the toilet, it wasn't a pleasant experience!

Keith Seward,bigseward@hotmail.com,"More than 12 months ago, but within the last 2 years",2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,None of these,Not Answered,"We flew with Ryanair from Bristol airport to Malaga airport on the 20th June 2017 flight numbers FR8121 and FR8122.

I didn't pay to 'choose' my seat as I believe that the addition of this charge should be illegal. The consistent pay as you go nature of airline travel needs to stop and single ticket prices need to return that include meals/ drinks/seats and luggage. Airlines can then be profitable again and we stop feeling like they are scamming us.

I booked our flight to Spain to see my partners parents but waited until the required '24 -48 hours' before flying check-in time that Ryanair demands. This is when they give you your boarding pass that you have to print (or use their app) and allocate your seat. 
While I was going through the motions online and clicked the random allocate button, I spotted that we were not put together. This was very odd because there were at least 15 options that they could have sat us together. Also, we were both put into the middle of a 3 row of seats, one of us towards the front and one of us towards the back. This then means that 6 seats have been disrupted so people cannot sit together. Interestingly Ryanair claim this is totally random but surely it's in their interests to keep seats free in case more people want to pay to sit together not block them? 
While I was online looking at this and feeling scammed, someone else must have been online and checked in as my seat disappeared and there was an error. I was told I needed to ring up to get my booking confirmed. 
Now, this is when it got interesting while speaking to Ryanair, the person confirmed that someone else was allocated the seat I had. I told them, my partners, seat number and explained how she had both seats either side of her free and it would be nice to sit together as she is pregnant and scared of flying.
 I was told they would 'speak to someone'
When they came back the answer was 'sorry it's totally random would you like to pay' 
I thought sod it ill pay for 1. the buggers.
I was then told 'no I have to pay for both' even though my partner's seat had already been allocated.
This annoyed me a bit so I said nope just allocate my seat. Surely this is illegal? apparently not....
Surprise surprise my seat was deliberately not anywhere near my partner and in the middle of yet another row of 3 with empty seats either side of me.

Now interestingly on the plane chaos ensued because people were running up and down the plane to talk to their partners while the poor staff were trying to get people in their seats so we didn't miss our takeoff window. They should have expected this if they were deliberately sitting people apart.

Also to rub salt in the wound, both the seats either side of my partner were empty throughout the flight so I could have been allocated one of them.

Needless to say, I felt scammed, this was a deliberate attempt by a shameless airline that tries different scams all the time to scrape extra money out of people and cause unnecessary stress when you're going on holiday. I am pleased you are looking into this and feel free to contact me to discuss this further. 

Later in the year, we flew with Monarch (The day before they went bust) and the random allocation sat us together as it should if there is space to do so. On a side note, I would like to thank you for your handling of that time as we felt well looked after by the CAA. 

Warm regards 

Keith - Never flying with Ryanair again I would rather pay more for my flight at a different airport than fly with them again, that's how scammed I felt.",2018-02-07 12:41:20,ANON-VXSB-EZM4-3,"92.23.229.242,127.0.0.1",2018-02-07 12:11:39,v3.6.0-v3-frontend,open,Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/57.0,2018-02-07 12:41:33,Introduction,Airline seating allocations

On checking the seating plan where we could have selected seats, it was obvious that many pairs of seats remained unallocated at the time of booking and check in.  We were allocated far apart 'random' seats (check in was 'open' at time of booking as we were within 60 days of the flight).

We have a holiday home and fly five or six return flights a year.  We usually use both Ryanair and Easyjet regularly and don't pay for allocated seats.  Our recent experience is that Easyjet invariably allocate us seats together, without extra payment, but Ryanair ALWAYS deliberately allocate seats many rows apart, despite many pairs of seats actually being available because they had not been reserved by others making payment to do so.

Regardless of what they pass it off as, they purposely split people up to try and force them to pay extra when booking.

Easyjet will keep group bookings together, yet ryanair split up 3 seperate 2-person bookings into 3 individual seats on different rows?  Slime.

Theres no point reporting anything to ryanair, they barely follow regulations when theyre legally obliged to so they wont do a thing about customer complaints.

If they arent prevented from doing this, its going to turn into a mess onboard.

We have travelled in various groups on approximately 6 return flights. We have never been sat together, on any of them.  On one flight from Stanstead to Madrid when there were 6 of us, who had booked at the same time; we were all given middle seats a various positions on the plane.
Another flight from Stanstead to Castellon, my husband and I were separated, even though I had an entire row of seats to myself and there was a spare seat next to him as well.
My husband is a retired fire officer and he wrote to Ryanair, asking them to consider the situation, that if there was an’incident’ on one of their flights, with so many people being split up from their loved ones, there could be absolute chaos. It is human nature, that people would desperately try to find their loved ones, rather than head for the nearest emergency exit.  Ryanair’s response was,  that if we were unhappy about the seating, we like every other passenger, had the opportunity to pay to sit together. 
Prior to May 2017 we had never experienced this problem and were always seated together as a group.

 I had a rather large   gentleman standing in the isle leaning so close, I was sitting in the isle seat, he was standing   talking to the lady who was next to me in the middle seat.
 I got so fed up with them having a conversation across me I suggested in the end we changed seats. Other people were calling several rows back and forward to each other.

July 2017 same journey with Ryanair 2 adults - one sat at front of plane and one at rear although plane not full and we both had empty seats nearby. I did raise issue with stewardess as boarding passes for both of us on my phone and we boarded at opposite ends of the plane. She was not interested , very abrupt
and said that was our problem and we both needed our passes to board.  Had pre empted this problem and my travelling companion had photographed his pass. Did raise this issue when giving feedback but no response from Ryanair. 
My son lives in Germany and often uses this Ryanair flight.  Since middle of 2017 always split up from his girlfriend.  Frustration is Ryanair only provider on this route so unable to protest at this treatment by using a different airline.

Also travel a couple of times each year with Tui.  Never any problem with seating arrangements always sat together. 

Don't mind been separated if it's a full flight but splitting bookings up just to make customers pay extra to sit together seems to be the policy with some airlines.

There are so many add-ons to a booking that paying extra to guarantee seats together on both outbound and inbound flights that it can add a significant amount to the overall cost. What’s also important to remember is that they advertise seats at the lowest cost - ie the rows right at the back of the plane. These sell out first leaving no option but to be faced with upwards of £20 to reserve a middle of the plane seat. If easy jet, Norwegian and many other low cost airlines can operate with an alternative model how can Ryanair justify this? They know that people will pay extra to sit together but it’s just morally wrong. A booking with the same ref no should guarantee seats together.

I over the next day or two I kept checking the seating plan, and eventually all the middle seats had gone (except extra legroom middle seats at £16 extra, and priority middle seats at the front of the plane at £9 extra).

We paid the additional price for Priority Boarding so that we could both have two pieces of hand luggage. Ryanair also only allow you to check in online four days before your flight unless you are prepared to pay to have an allocated seat which we were not prepared to do. On checking in we were given the option of choosing our seats but chose not to as we didn't want to pay the extra. Subsequently, we were given seats several rows apart. This is despite the fact that there were empty seats on the flight and one row of seats had only one occupant near to where my Husband sat.

We were informed the flight was full.  He said there is a new policy and that we would need to pay more to sit together.  Our flight out to Santiago did not have the same problem and we were merely sat together.
 
We were advised that the only way to sit together back to Heathrow was to upgrade to Business class.
 
Making clear that we were not happy the check in person who was helpful and understanding said he would try to accommodate us by moving passengers around.  This he could only do at the gate.  So we were in suspense, allocated with middle seats between passengers, many rows apart, and we were not at all happy, despite checking in over 3 hours in advance.
 
He also called his supervisor who confirmed the upgrade option.  Then saying he would see what he could do.
 
At the gate we, along with a number of other passengers were called to the desk to be given new boarding passes allowing us to sit together.
 
There appears to be a clear policy to have passengers to pay for seats to sit together, this can only be to make more money, but BA are not concerned about passengers and don’t realise they are better off just charging the variance across the whole flight to keep passengers happy.  If a seat booking IS £30 per passenger then I’m sure £60 for a couple included at the outset is preferable to becoming an unhappy passer and the repute of the airline and CAA isa at stake, for not policing, what is in effect exploitation and forcing of upgrades.
 
I have not bothered writing to BA as the usual unsatisfactory answer would be received. 
 
The irony is, we were seated in row 16 and my seat was faulty, it was not locked into the upright position and rocked back and forward also to the annoyance of the passenger in the row behind.  Had I paid extra for this seat (emergency row with no seats infront additional leg room etc) then I would not have been happy either.

It was also apparent that although you can go back into their site and change your seat after allocation, the pricing is higher to select a seat during this process.  I only managed to find 1 Seat priced at £4 during this process.

Once I became aware of the issue, I then contacted their customer service.  It is 13p per minute to phone, so I went on to their online chat.  It took 2 hours and 3 attempts to get no where other than go back and pay more.  And I got the distinct impression that the CS staff just cut you off when the conversations gets difficult.

During online check in for the return flight NY JFK to Manchester we were automatically sat apart in different rows and to select seats together we had to pay an additional cost. We did not complete online check in instead opting to wait until the airport as we thought that there must be a problem which they could sort for us at the airport. 

On arrival at the airport we did the check in process at a computer, when it again automatically sat us separately we called a staff member over. The staff member said there was no problem and that we had to pay to select our seats to sit together despite there being plenty of available seats. When we said that we would not pay the staff member at check in suggested that we should get to the boarding gate early to ask at the desk at the boarding gate if they could reallocate our seats. Therefore we finished the check in process selecting seats that were apart. 

We were some of the first people to arrive at the boarding gate, when a staff member arrived at the desk at the boarding gate we approached her and explained the situation asking if we could be allocated new seats. Thankfully she was very helpful and stated that she had already noticed that our group was sat apart and was happy to allocate us with new seats sat together. She issued us with new boarding cards and thankfully we were able to sit together for the flight. 

During the flight it was obvious that we were not the only group that had been allocated separate seats from our travelling group during check in but these groups hadn't had their situation resolved as ours had been.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42931091
 
In response to the BBC article (see link above) on Airline Operators abuse of their seating policy. I would like to confirm that Ryan Air is a consistent abuser of such acts, based on my personal experience in using this operator. I usually travel with my husband as a party of 2 and so far they have split us on both legs of the flights that we have been on with this operator.
 
 I would ask the CAA to review the algorithms used and seating policies of airliners to ensure that they are not maliciously trying to split parties in order to force travellers to pay a charge to sit next to each other. I am happy if airline operators are not able to provide a guarantee of seating passengers together while offering a service to pay for such a guarantee. However if airline operators are maliciously using algorithms to split parties up then this is an abuse on consumer protection laws and rights. In addition there should be severe fines for breaches to deter operators from carrying out such practices in the future.
 
From my experience with Easy Jet & Jet2, I have not had this issue.

If my recent experience is anything to go by, it is most definitely the policy of some airlines, e.g. Ryanair, to deliberately split up groups when 'randomly' allocating seats. 

Back in May 2017 I checked in my parents and their friends for a Ryanair East Midlands-Dublin flight. My parents and their friends did not want to book an allocated seat as they weren't fussed about their location on the plane. However, they did mistakenly assume that they would be seated together. As you will see below by the seats allocated, this couldn't be further from the truth. They were allocated the following seats:

7B
8B
9B
10B
12E
14B
14C
14E
15B
19B
20B
21B
22B
23B
25C
29B
32B
33B

As you can see, apart from row 14, the group of 18 adults were scattered all over the plane and away from one another. Stranger still, most were allocated middle seats. I find it highly implausible that this happened at random.

Due to the seats allocated for the outbound flight, many of my parents' friends decided to pay the fee to select an allocated seat so that they could sit with their partner on their return flight. 

It disgusts me that the underhand tactics of some airlines has succeeded in unfairly lining their pockets. I do hope that you can do something about it.

The unpaid for adults were randomly allocated: 23e/29e/11e/12e.
There were enough spaces (had we paid to chose) so that we could have all sat together. I feel we were deliberately split up to encourage us to pay next time. 
I feel this policy is dangerous. If there was an emergency evacuaton parents would try to reach their children at all costs causing potential chaos.

When we boarded the plane it was far from full and there many empty seats around us — so much so that there was an onboard announcement instructing passengers not to move from their allocated seats as this could affect  the weight distribution and jeopardise safety!
Our experience left no doubt in our mind that the method of seat allocation was a deliberate ploy to extract more money from passengers.

On the return flight this was 4A and 5C even though there were seats next to each other in Rows 6, 7 & 8.   We are BA Frequent Flyers (not for much longer based on this and other recent BA flight ‘experiences’) so we were able to change the seats 7 days before the flights.   When we phoned BA customer service regarding this they weren't interested despite their terms and conditions stating they will ""do their best to sit you together"".  Instead they tried to sell us seats for the long-haul flights we have booked for an extra charge of £400.  We have now reluctantly paid £200 for our outward flights, what we consider to be an extortion amount to guarantee seats together when we already have business class tickets.

We have flown to Ireland with Ryanair for years, and because my Husband & I book on the same booking, even the randomly allocated seats were allocated within the same row & we were always sat together.
However, Friends travelled with Ryanair last May & it was the first time we were made aware of the new seat allocation process, and it appeared that passengers who had not pre-paid for allocated seats were invariably allocated seats in seat 'B' and 'E' (ie the middle seat) and were located several rows apart.
Allegedly, from a newspaper report I read, Ryanair had gone from using a seating algorithm which allocated seats laterally to allocating vertically instead (I cannot verify this, but anecdotal evidence appears to back-up the theory).
So, I have felt the need to book seats together since then, adding at least £8  per booking to my flights.

We are regular travellers to Athens from Stansted with Ryan Air (approx 3 times per year). Prior to 12 months ago we always checked in online and always without exception were automatically allocated seats that were contiguous. Approx 12 months ago we booked and checked in online and found that our seat allocation was widely dispersed in the aircraft. Although, this didn't cause too much of a complication we put this down to pure ""bad luck"". Last September (2017) we once again booked and checked in online expecting that Ryan Air's seat allocation would revert to it's normal sane behaviour and were amazed to experience the same wide dispersion of allocated seats. It is clear to me that Ryan Air have deliberately changed their algorithm to deliberately split up groups so that they will pay for a seat allocation. One of our party is suffering from dementure and we are now in a position where we are FORCED into paying extra in order to sit together when before this happened automatically.

It is a disgraceful practice that should be banned with immediate effect.  They are ""selling"" us something that used to a standard component of the ticket.  What happens to this money?
As I frequent flyer, I am struggling to identify where it is going.  For example, in 2015, Emirates did not charge for any seats.  However, over time, and by stealth, they have re-branded their seating areas, e.g. to standard, extra legroom, etc. and selling them for up to £75 per journey.  This is beyond extortionate - daylight robbery.  

Simultaneously, Emirates, together with other airlines, has steadily reduced their service on board e.g. reduced meals and refreshments on long-haul flights.

All airlines should be made to stop this practice.  Customers should be able to choose - for free - whether they would like to be seated together or apart from their family, friends or colleagues.  Or if travelling alone, where they would like to sit for personal reasons. 

It should be stopped because it is immoral and constitutes product mis-selling.  The ticket is promoted at X price which then inflates after purchase to XX price if you wish to be seated together or to choose if travelling alone.  The practice affects everyone, including those who are travelling with children, the elderly and the vulnerable who cannot or do not wish to be separated from their companions.  Also, those with health and mobility issues who wish to have an aisle seat and/or to be seated near the WC.

More seriously, this practice should be stopped because in the event of an accident THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS in passengers exiting the aircraft because they will block the aisles trying to locate their loved ones and companions.  

Therefore, for practical, moral and safety reasons, this practice should be stopped with immediate effect. 

If the greedy airlines wish to make even more money out than they do already of their customers, despite the fact that they continue to extort money from us by stealth, e.g. refreshments, checked baggage, etc.  they should simply go back to the days when the headline price of the ticket included seat selection.

Their grubby efforts to steal money from customers by selling us seats that were previously free is having an adverse effect on air travel e.g. it takes longer to board as those who are separated spend additional time finding their seat and locating the other seat(s).  

This is in addition to the equally immoral,  illegal and unsafe practice of steadily reducing the seat pitch to cram as many seats into the aircraft as possible and charging for refreshments (even water - BA, Easyjet, Ryanair).

If you raise any concerns with the airlines about seating, they will send you a meaningless stock reply.  They do not care.  Their call centres are devoid of customer service and are designed to pickpocket you further by keeping you on the £££ line listening to toneless music for hours on end then cutting you off when you finally get through to a human based anywhere but the UK.

Furthermore, the remaining 2 seats in the row of 6 were taken by a mother and son who in turn were seated separately from the father who was seated 3 rows in front of them.
Surely if you book as a family group the airline should seat you as a group.

I reported our concerns to Jet2 who basically told me that we were given the option of booking our seats for a small fee of £148.   This £148 was in addition to the £2155.40 we had already paid for our tickets.

Practically everyone I know who buy airline tickets expect to be seated together. 

 I am appalled that Jet2 seem to think it is ok to separate families on a holiday flight just because they haven't been pressurised into paying the exorbitant fees for allocated seats. 

If I buy tickets for a football match I don't have to pay extra to sit together
If I buy tickets for a train journey I don't have to pay extra to sit together
If I buy tickets for a ferry I don't have to pay extra to sit together
If I buy tickets for a bus/coach I don't have to pay extra to sit together

I don't expect the CAA to do very much about this as it is just another excuse for the Airline industry to make extra money.

Phil Harper,phillip.a.harper@gmail.com,"More than 1 month ago, but within the last 3 months",2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,None of these,Don’t know / can’t recall,"I have two recent flying experiences of being separated, both with Ryanair. On neither occasion did we pay to choose our seats, and on both occasions we were separated.

On the most recent occasion, we travelled from London Stansted to Verona. We were seated several rows apart, but when we boarded the flight it was immediately apparent that the flight was only half full, and both of us had been allocated the middle seat in an empty row. I believe that this demonstrates how Ryanair, despite their claim not to, are deliberately penalising passengers who do not wish to pay any additional money on top of the 'advertised fare' and are purposefully seating them in middle rows several rows apart.

On the first occasion, we flew from London Gatwick to Belfast. Here, the flight was nearly full, and many people were seated several rows apart (including my partner and I). As the flight reached cruising altitude, and the fasten seat-belt sign was turned off, this immediately signalled what can only be described as a farcical situation where a substantial number of people on the flight immediately moved around the cabin, swapping seats with others or taking up previously empty seats, so they could sit with the accompanying group. This appeared to me to be a very unsafe situation and one that could have been simply avoided had Ryanair not forced non-paying passengers to sit several rows apart.

I have every sympathy with low-cost airlines trying to maximise their incoming from passengers, and indeed have absolutely no problem with current baggage rules and the like. However, on the two occasions I have flown with Ryanair, it has been apparent that by refusing to pay any extra beyond the headline fare, many passengers are being deliberately penalised and forced to sit apart, even at times when flights are not fully occupied.",2018-02-11 10:47:34,ANON-VXSB-EZ7F-Y,"90.198.67.207,127.0.0.1",2018-02-11 10:37:39,v3.6.0-v3-frontend,open,Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0,2018-02-11 10:47:38,Introduction,Airline seating allocations

Until last year me and my husband have always been automatically allocated seats together when checking in online without the need to buy a seat.  In May 2017 we checked in online as usual and were very surprised to find ourselves sat separately, rows apart.  I researched this online and found other people were also suddenly having the same issue.  As a test when I checked in online for my return flight back to the UK, I viewed seat availability which you can do before buying a seat.  There were plenty of pairs of seats adjacent to each other.  I declined to purchase a seat so went through automatic allocation and was again given 2 separate seats, aisles apart despite there being plenty available together.  I viewed this as a deliberate change by Ryanair to force people into buying seats if they wanted to sit together.  I wanted to know why Ryanair weren't being upfront about this change to the algorithm for seat allocation when no seat purchase had been made, so I complained.  I received this reply which did not answer my question.

""Dear Mrs Chapman,  

Thank you for contacting Ryanair.

In relation to your recent correspondence I would like to inform you that we do our best to seat families together, however this will not always be possible. If you want to be guaranteed seats together we recommend that you purchase seats in advance.

We object to paying extra  to sit together as we are just a couple and we’ve already paid for our seats when we paid for the flights.  To accommodate a couple is much easier than accommodating a large group.  On the last three flights that  we’ve taken and on one tomorrow we have been separated.  I understand that they will prioritise people who are willing to pay extra BUT on ALL the flights we’ve taken with Ryanair when this has happened, there have not only been empty seats ( in twos) but also empty rows. Clearly we were separated deliberately and not because it was impossible to actually seat us together.  We think this is essentially little short of blackmail.  On our last flight there was one man lying down over three seats and the steward refused to ask him to let us sit together on that row even though WE were SEVEN rows apart.

When I checked in on the first possible day, the plane was only half allocated. 
We had to enter ages for all passengers - so the computer knew there were two children travelling.

When the computer site allocated us seats, they were apart - sprinkled all over the plane. This despite there being many free seats available that were three together in a row.

Obviously we had the option to pay extra to sit together, but I resent paying extra to sit with my children. It's just price-gouging - it doesn't cost an airline extra to set the computer algorithms to sit groups together. I also think that if you pay, it just encourages the airlines to continue to cheat us like this. If they don't make any money out of it, they will stop doing it.

When we boarded the plane, we took our allocated seats - I was about 10 rows back from the children. But there was a spare seat in the row behind one of them, so I sat there. When the person next to me saw what I was doing, he was sympathetic and said, ""They did that to us, too - we're travelling in a group and they've sat us all over the plane.""

Obviously it then tried to charge us to move seats. I looked at the seats still available, and there were many seats empty that were in a group of three.

But I didn't pay the extra to sit together. I don't believe it's acceptable to have to pay to sit with your own children on a plane. Sitting together doesn't incur any costs for the airline, so it's just money-gouging.

The flight is only an hour. And my children have flown many times before. But had it been a longer flight, I would have felt it necessary to sit near them.

I also don't want to encourage this behaviour. If nobody pays for this and the airlines can't make money out of it, they will stop doing it.

We were told that we would be refunded for the extra we had paid.  This was not automaticaaly done and before settling the final payment we had to remind Virgin Holidays that the charge for seat allocations needed to be removed.

When boarding our outbound flight we checked that our (paid for) seats for the return flight were still confirmed and were reassured that they were. On check in for our retrurn flight we found out that our seats were all over the plane (over two levels), when questioning this we were told that the flight had been changed and as a result our seats reallocated.  This was not true.  This was the flight we had always been booked on.  We later discovered that an earlier flight had been combined with our flight and that was why are seats had been changed (even though we had paid for specific seats).  The check in desk were not interested in this and said we would need to take this up with customer services once we had returned. What was surprising is that there were plenty of seats available together where some of the party ended up sitting, even though we were now in different sections of the plane;  people were sitting upstairs and some downstairs.  Six of the party were seated in an area of the plane with no entertainment system and this is where the additional seats were.

On our return we had to contact customer services for a refund.  Not all our seats were refunded (the refund was given because we had no entertainment system for six of the passengers not for sitting in difefrent places to our booking). They would not refund two of the setas as they were extra leg room seatss and these incur an additional cost (similar to what we had already paid), even though they were not the setas we had booked.",2018-02-11 17:30:19,ANON-VXSB-EEDB-K,"77.100.103.198,127.0.0.1",2018-02-11 17:13:38,v3.6.0-v3-frontend,open,Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0,2018-02-11 17:30:25,Introduction,Airline seating allocations

Roger Talbot,rogertoontalbot@hotmail.com,Within the last month,1,,1,,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,None of these,Not Answered,"Out of principle, I won't pay to sit with my daughter. Most airlines can perfectly manage to ensure those that book together can sit together, so I fail to see why this is beyond the capability of Ryanair, and other airlines that charge for this 'privilege'. My daughter is aged 12, and we have been allocated seats together in all other trips, but this time, I guess they consider her old enough to sit alone.

Upon online check-in, I saw that our seats were very much apart. In fact, they weren't even close. When I checked the Ryanair website for available seating, I saw that much better and closer seating could have been allocated for us - but, of course, they do this in order to increase the pressure on a passenger to 'give up' and buy seating.

I queried this with Ryanair via their Facebook chat, and was simply told that aisle and window seats were kept for those passengers that wished to pay extra to sit together. Middle seats were for those that weren't prepared to pay. In my opinion, for anyone that makes a flight booking with others, forcing them to sit separately is pathetic, outrageous and is downright price-gouging. A copy of this conversation has been kept, and I'm happy to let you see this, if you want.

I even checked to see what spare seats there were on the flight on the morning of travel. Assuming virtually everyone had checked in by then, seats were still available together and it would've been easy to ensure my daughter and I sat beside each other. However, nobody was willing / able to make the official change, and I was told to just move once on the plane. 

As you can guess, I wasn't the only one in this situation, and many others were scrambling around asking other passengers to move (along with their bags!), so that a party could sit together. This, I feel, delays the cabin being ready for take off and, frankly, must raise some safety concerns. 

Anyway, I'm happy to be contacted in any way, and hope you're able to bring an end to this ridiculous policy.",2018-02-11 18:11:21,ANON-VXSB-EZ78-H,"92.15.2.96,127.0.0.1",2018-02-11 15:12:07,v3.6.0-v3-frontend,open,Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0,2018-02-11 18:11:29,Introduction,Airline seating allocations

Stephen Jameson,srjameson1@gmail.com,Within the last month,2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,We did sit together,£10 - £14.99,"My wife and I have just checked in for a Ryanair flight from London Stansted to Malaga on 16/2/2018. We were offered many opportunities to select our seats - at a price. We declined these opportunities and were allocated seats 10e(middle) and 20e(middle). We were then offered yet another opportunity to purchase seats together if we were unhappy with the allocated seats. Looking at the seating map, it showed that seats 10d, 10f, 20d and 20 f  were all unallocated at that time. We were offered the opportunity to swap from 20e to 10d for £13 or from 10e to 20d for £11. We took the latter option.
It seems clear to me that Ryanair’s seating algorithm deliberately allocates the least attractive seating option it can find in order to pressurise passengers into paying for a change of seats.
In the last ten years, my wife and I have taken approximately 80 Easyjet flights and although we have never paid for allocated seating, we have NEVER been seated apart.

Good luck with your enquiry,

Jeanette Crosby,n3ttys1@gmail.com,Within the last month,4,0,0,0,"Yes, I/they did",Ryanair,,We did sit together,£15 - 19.99,"I paid the extra for all of us to sit together as one of the group had epilepsy. We wanted aisle seats also.  The allocation was  good for our group but expensive.
When we got on the flight we found that the people who hadn't allocated them selves a seat where very rude and expected you( who had paid) to move over to another seat. So until you told them you paid for the seat they then shut up but muttered. This causes alot of tension in the Cabins between customers.

Arturas Martinkevic,arturas.martinkevic@bt.com,Within the last month,2,0,1,1,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,None of these,Less than £5,"I have booked a flight with Ryanair for my family, 2 x adults, 1 child and 1 infant.
Ryanair provides a free allocated seat to a child, but has demanding for either me or my wife to pay a seat reservation fee as one of us has to sit next to our child? I feel this is a rip off as it is a mandatory requirement from all airlines that a minor has to be accompanied by an adult, in our case one of the parents needs to be seated next to our daughter who is 3 years old. As this is a requirement why am I being charged/penalised for this? I don't have a preference where to be seated, there for I don't think this is acceptable, this is a blatant overcharge as technically I did not choose to sit next to my daughter, but was forced to do so due to the aviation rules/law and there for I should not be charged any extra fees for this, simply because I travel with a child?

William Frost,william_frost1986@hotmail.com,More than 2 years ago,3,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",Not Answered,Delta,We did sit together,Not Answered,"On the outbound flight we (the party of three) were seated together.  On the return flight however when we went to check in on-line only a few seats were showing as available (despite us logging on just after the 24 hour window opened).  We had no option but to select the remaining three seats that were available.  This was frustrating because we were all under one booking party so assumed we would be sat together.  For an overnight long-haul flight, this was somewhat distressing.
Upon arrival at the airport, we spoke to a member of staff who told us that we woud need to speak to the flight crew at the gate.  We arrived much earlier at the gate than required (thereby reducing our chances to relax prior to the flight) to ensure we were sat next to the desk.  When a member of the flight crew arrived, she was busy on the computer.  Allowing her time to finish, we went up and queried the party of three being sat in three seperate locations.  She advised that she had just moved us so we were sat together, and said she had done this for many people.  
When we got on the plane, someone came over and asked if we were all one party as he was sat away from his party and wanted one of us to swap.  We overheard numerous people on the plane discussing the issue (one party had become visibly distressed at the situation with the flight crew), and realised that it was a major issue.",2018-02-12 17:56:31,ANON-VXSB-EEXT-S,"86.180.120.15,127.0.0.1",2018-02-12 17:49:39,v3.6.0-v3-frontend,open,Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/57.0,2018-02-12 17:56:41,Introduction,Airline seating allocations

Andrew Facherty,Facherty@BTInternet.com,Within the last month,2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,None of these,Not Answered,"1. I have flown with RyanAir on at least 20 occasions in the last 10 years, often as a group of four.
2. I have never opted to pay for seat allocation with RyanAir (nor with easyJet or Flybe)
3. Until Autumn 2017, our 'random' seat allocation with RyanAir always resulted in the group being in the same row, whether there two, three or four of us. It is almost impossible for this to be truly random. Further evidence of the lack of a 'random' allocation is that we never one ended up on a premium seat.
4. Since Autumn 2017, we have never been sat together
5. The most recent example was on Thu 18 Jan 2018, FR1070 from Valencia to Edinburgh, departing at 07:00. The flight was, at most, one third full. Our party of two was separated by 20 rows. Most of the rows in between were entirely empty.
6. I did not report any concerns to the airline - their policy of 'random allocation' was clearly; however, it had not applied at all in the past

I think I might be a good witness to a change in RyanAir's practice, since I generally keep a copy on my computer of all our boarding passes. I can show quite simply that a group with a single booking always used to travel together; never on the ""good"" seats, but always together.

I have another flight tomorrow with RyanAir, and even when downloading my boarding passes to a second iPhone, after checking in on the first to get yet another separated seat allocation, I am again offered the opportunity to sit together. This means that at least one of our seats has a space beside it.

NB: your question 8 above has no opportunity for a null response

It was also hard to complete Question 7 since our reason was ""We had always sat together in the cheap seats without paying the airline even more"".

Patrick Dunphy,two.pats@tiscali.co.uk,Within the last month,2,,,,"Yes, I/they did",Ryanair,,We wanted to sit together but it was too expensive to pay extra to do so,Not Answered,"The CAA have a duty to ensure passenger safety is never compromised. Hopefully there are tried and tested measures in place so that if airlines wish to change their seating arrangement policies then the CAA is confident, from research already undertaken, that such changes do not present a greater risk to passengers.  For example, aircraft evacuation procedures should not be undermined due to random selected seating where a couple have been placed 13 rows apart.  If the CAA are not confident that safety standards are being maintained then changes to seating arrangement policies should not be allowed to be implemented until such time that vigorous research has been done. In a worse case scenario, passengers who refuse to pay extra to sit together and instead are seated 13 rows apart should not be placed in the awful, although admittedly rare, situation where there is an emergency on board which precludes the possibility of evacuation. The chances of this happening may be slim but it does happen. Nobody should ever have to hold the hand or say their last ""goodbye"" to a complete stranger. Sitting next to your partner should not be regarded as a paid for privilege.   
Ryanair's current random seating policy is not fair. The model being used is deliberately intended to split passengers up if they do not pay extra to sit together. It is a model which would not work well if it were applied to cinemas, theatres, sports arenas or even restaurants. There is no confusion as the CAA claim; passengers have to either pay extra to sit together or be assigned middle seats.   
On our recent outward journey with Ryanair my wife and I were allocated randomly selected middle seats which were 12 rows apart: for the return journey the randomly allocated middle seats were 13 rows apart. On this occasion our break was for only 4 days so we were able to check-in our return journey whilst still in the UK, which was within Ryanair's time limit, but if our break had been for 5 days or longer then our check-in for the return journey for random selected seating would have to be made abroad. 
Ryanair's current random selected seating policy is not transparent. Whilst Ryanair call centre  staff may not have been instructed to say they operate a deliberate policy of splitting couples up, any queries regarding middle seat allocation are met with the same scripted response, namely passengers can pay extra if they wish to sit together.
Ryanair do not need to be publicly open about their seating policy; the model they use for seating allocation says it for them. Ryanair must know approximately how many couples will be travelling on any particular given flight, and the model they use must be able to determine the percentage of that figure they need to obtain from couples prepared to pay to sit together in order to maximize  their profits. It should then follow that there will be a small percentage of randomly allocated seating where seats are next to each other but Ryanair does not readily indicate how these seats can be freely booked. 
Ryanair's check-in page exclaims ""avoid the middle seat"", as if it were some form of contagious illness. It would be interesting to know the extent to which this is contradicted by the number of instances where couples who have paid to sit together include one of them sitting in a middle seat.  Furthermore, on board announcements now state that passengers should not move from their allocated seats so as not to disturb weight distribution throughout the aircraft. This is a ridiculous situation especially where there might be two empty seats together but the airline has not done enough sufficiently beforehand to allow passengers to book them.
Ryanair and all other carriers know there are a limited number of choices available to passengers travelling to certain destinations. Passengers, like ourselves, have paid months in advance to book seats and those monies are already gaining interest for the airlines.  
Customer satisfaction is not an airline's main priority. We have booked three further flights this year with Ryanair and, after our recent experiences, feel we are in a much better position to consider all options .
Although this opportunity to comment on Ryanair's random seating allocation policy has been welcomed concerns have been raised by others for over a year which should have been addressed earlier.

Our situation was that we were flying with the following:
4 x Adults over 18, one of whom had never flown before and was nervous
3 x Children of ages 6, 7 and 10, two of whom were fully documented and diagnosed as Autistic
1 x Baby under 1 year
The visit was to take the children to visit their great grandparents for, most likely, the last time due to the failing health of the said grandparents.
The flight was chosen as it was the most economical for a family, especially during school term.
The cost of chosen seats was found to be an additional £11 per person each way and seemed to also include children, thus and additonal £77 each way.  The cost was not shown until after all booking information had been completed.  When contacting the company, they could not seem to understand that the children being seated away from one parent would have caused distress which would have also, likely, disrupted other passengers.
After a number of telephone conversations and exchange of documentation to support the diagnosis of Autism, it was agreed to seat us together without charge, however the whole process was troubling and made the option to travel by air, as a family or group a much less favourable option.  I believe that the costs advertised from the start should include the cost of an allocated seat and that it is assumed that groups, especially families will want to sit together.  Reductions could be offered to those who are happy to give up their set seat

When I saw the seats that were allocated automatically by the system there were 2 seats together at the front of the aircraft and one at the back. There were closer seats to the front available for the single passenger allocated to the back so I tried again the have the seats automatically allocated. I thought that the system could recognise that we were one party and that they would at least seat us at the closest point possible. This was not the case.

I emailed Tui to complain as whilst I appreciated that we may not be seated together I would at least expect out of duty of care of mere customer service to be seated at the closest available seat to the rest of the family. There were two adults and my son who was 10 yrs at the time.

I have worked overseas as an overseas resort manager and it was company policy to seat our customers as close together as possible - especially families. Tui did ensure that my son was with one adult however I suspect the system was programmed to ensure this.

Before confirming seats and the flight I tried going back into the system many times to get other (automatically allocated) closer seats allocated however there was no change. I called the helpline to see if I could be allocated the seat about 5 rows behind my partner and child instead of at the very back of the aircraft but was told I would have to pay.  

All this was documented in my email to Tui and below is the reply I received. pls note it is addressed to my partner as I think he was the lead name:

Dear Mr. Galiatsatos,

Thank you for your recent feedback with regards to your holiday experience with Thomson and First Choice, I am sorry to hear of the issues that you have raised.

I understand that when you had checked in you had two seats together and one seat a considerable distance away which I can appreciate would have been concerning to you which I am sorry for however, without using the select your seat option Thomson cannot guarantee that you will be sat together.

I can see that there was a seat closer to where the two seats were situated however, this would have been calculated on how busy that particular flight was and is at random when people do not pay.


I appreciate this would have been frustrating also as if you asked upon checking in at the airport you may have received them for free however, this cannot be guaranteed unless you were to pay the select your seat supplement.


Thank you again for your feedback, I hope that other than this that you enjoyed your holiday experience. I am sorry for the inconvenience that this would have caused.


Yours sincerely,
Abbi Keenan

Robert Nixon,robert_nixon@mail.com,Within the last month,2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,We did not sit together as we were not bothered enough about being separated to pay extra to sit together,Not Answered,"We are always book our flights on the same PNR. Ryanair have consistently seated us as far apart as possible, even when the seatmap shows that pairs of adjoining seats were available at the time of checking-in.

Furthermore, as soon as the free seating allocation was completed, Ryanair attempted to up sell adjacent seats to us - an offer which we did not take up.

The seat allocation algorithm used by Ryanair is not random. It is clearly designed to separate groups of passengers in an attempt to generate ancillary income.  

I appreciate that it is in Ryanair's commercial interest that their headline fare always appears at the top of  search results. That headline fare would appear much further down the list if all of the ancillary fees (including seat selection) were included at the outset.

Our flights are generally less than three hours in duration so it is not essential that we are seated together. However, Ryanair's policy positively discriminates against families and those with special needs who have no option but to pay the additional fees if it is essential that they are seated together. 

Customers have quickly seen through this attempt at blackmail. Once on board, voluntary seat swapping takes place, groups get to sit together and excessive fees are avoided.

Thank you for investigating this predatory sharp practice.

Thomas Roach,pawtom@ntlworld.com,Within the last month,2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",British Airways (BA),,We wanted to sit together but it was too expensive to pay extra to do so,Not Answered,"I have recently read an article concerning the above topic and would be interested in your comments on my experience.

At the moment I am in Buenos Aires and will be returning to the UK tomorrow on a British Airways flight. The outbound flight was to Santiago from Heathrow last month. My wife and I travelled business class and booked the flights last April. I was astounded that despite paying a premium price for the seats that there was a seat allocation charge if I wanted to book specific seats. As it turned out, my wife was on a completely different row to me after we used the free on-line check-in facility and we were told there was no scope to alter this when we dropped off our luggage.  Additionally, we were both surrounded by single passengers who could have been moved if requested. I am assuming that the same will apply when I check-in for the return flight.

In contrast, last year we flew with Singapore Airlines to Auckland. Again, we booked the flights about 10 months ahead of the trip and we knew exactly where we were to sit at that time.

My suspicion is that BA, along with the budget airlines, are fleecing passengers by charging for seat allocation. Your investigation into the topic interests me and I will be challenging BA when I return home about their practice.

Jayne McConnachie,Waterside31@blueyonder.co.uk,Not Answered,,,,,Not Answered,Not Answered,,Not Answered,Not Answered,"Last April I booked a holiday with First Choice on booking reference 3877381.  Prior to travel we decided we would book seats to make sure we sat together but for some reason that day we could not do this online.  We phoned and First Choice offered us a window seat and the middle seat which was fine – we paid the fee.  On travelling we were given the seats we booked but no window.  On my return I sent various emails back and forth asking why I paid for a window seat which was quoted to me by one of their employees and never received one.  This went on for 5 months as when you contact the After Sales Team you have to wait for 28 days on a response.  I told them I didnt select my seats I was offered on the phone a window seat and middle to which I agreed to pay for but never received.  They totally blanked me and said I was not guaranteed a window seat.  

 

Surely this is just another step to add costs for consumers and not deliver – to me a window seat is a window seat.

 

To date which is 10 months on I still dont have an answer as when I asked who regulated them they just stopped communicating.

 

Wondering if this is correct and if so can this be added into your survey – thanks

Ralph McGuire,ralph@ralphm.eu,"More than 1 month ago, but within the last 3 months",2,1,0,0,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,We wanted to sit together but it was too expensive to pay extra to do so,Not Answered,"Our family of three travel regularly with Ryanair. On every one of the 100 or so flights taken between 2006 and spring 2017 we were allocated seats together without paying extra. Since spring 2017 we have been separated on every one of the eight flights taken.

 My main concern with Ryanair's change of seating algorithm is one of safety: should there be occasion to evacuate the aircraft in an emergency, will a husband in row 30 head promptly for the rear exit, or will he try and move forward against the flow in order to assist his wife in row 12? Will a mother in row 16 immediately leave via the over-wing exit, letting her 13 year-old child in row 24 fend for himself? Unlikely.

I understand that it is not always possible to seat travelling companions/families together on every flight, but I believe that airlines should be obliged to do their best to do so in order to prevent chaos during an emergency, which could cost lives.

On boarding at Seattle my wife and 2 other couples were split up as we had not paid the extra surcharge. By simply moving of a few passengers we managed to get 2 couples sat together.

BA viewpoint when I complained about this and other issues stated the International carriage by Air regulations and Montreal Convention applies and they are not liable for misrepresentation or breach of contract  under Domestic law . In addition BA state ""The  BA  website  is  advertising  material  and  the  representations contained therein are not contractual terms."" So BA can advertise what they  want they do not have to deliver it.  I took county court action against BA  for a number of failings not delivering what they advertised. The court ruled that I had no claim as on presenting a ticket for a flight at check in the Montreal Convention applies and BA are have only limited liability for Injury/loss/damage and delay. Airlines know this and this is why they are so arrogant.

I went through the booking process and then raised the issue to Ryanair suggesting perhaps they could change either my wife's or my own seat for one next to the other or both of us to a pair of available seats. I was told this would not be possible without an extra payment. I found this frustrating since there were numerous pairs of seats available to book at a price, which made it appear as a money-making mechanism.
When we embarked, we duly found plenty of pairs of seats unoccupied, confirming in my mind that it would have been possible to achieve this if the booking algorithm were more tuned to sit pairs/groups of travellers together.

We received flight details and the seats were all separate even though booked together.
I tried to change seats on American Airline website but came up, as £78 each seat.  I phoned the airline as there were seats within the same section that were free but still insisted on £78 to change seat so we could sit together, which I had to pay in order for us to sit together.
The return flight with BA , I paid £32 to book a seat before they were allocated as I imagined the same situation again where the airline would split the party in order to make the customer pay extra for sitting together.

Anthony Wood,AnthonyJamesWood@gmail.com,Within the last month,3,1,1,0,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,We wanted to sit together but it was too expensive to pay extra to do so,Not Answered,"I was seated with my 9 year old son, but otherwise all members of the party were all separated from each other, with individuals at the front of the plane, at the back and over the wing.  It was clearly Ryanair policy to split us up since we hadn't paid for 'priority boarding' rather than just chance.

SAFETY ISSUE: During the flight it struck me that rather than just being an attempt to get an extra £50 from a family of customers, the policy it was actually unsafe.  My 14 and 17 year olds are fairly independent, but in an emergency where the plane needed to be evacuated or the oxygen masks were deployed, they would look to their parents to know what to do, and we would definitely want to see they are safe.  In these dangerous scenarios all family groups that have been split up would look after each other and would try to fight their way past each other, up and down the plane if necessary, to check all members of their group are safe.   This could cause fatal delays in evacuation during a fire.

Whilst I find it unpleasant, I support Ryanair's right to drive down prices at the cost of some comfort, and give others the chance to buy back that comfort.  This seating policy, however is clearly unsafe and I'm afraid the CAA should step in to ensure groups are generally sat together.

There are enough groups of different sizes to allow all groups to be sat together and this is what the CAA should recommend on safety grounds.  The airlines will still have the opportunity to offer quieter seats at the front, or ones with more leg room over the wing exits for a price.

Well worth investigating.  

The three of us (one married couple and a single friend) did want to sit together on this long haul flight but didn’t really want to spend the extra money.  I monitored the seat availability running up to the 24 hours before departure and noted that not many seats had been reserved so I felt confident of being able to select 3 seats together (or at least 2).  Minutes after check-in opened, 24 hours before departure, I logged onto the Virgin website to choose our seats.  I was very surprised to find we had been dotted around the economy cabin and that it was impossible to change the seat allocation given to us.  

When we got to the airport the next day I queried this and was told it was probably because we were a group of three and the system probably couldn’t find three seats together. I queried why it would just let us choose to change at least one seat. No real answer.  Have to say I was a bit pissed off and didn’t really believe the answer I was given. 

Anyway we boarded the plane - flight VS300 on the 22/3/2016 LHR to Delhi (booking reference EK6G1W) and I sat in my allocated seat 46A.  My wife and our friend were several rows in front and behind respectively.  As the plane filled up I chatted to the person in seat 46C and eventually it looked like most passengers had boarded and seat 46B was unoccupied. So I said to the passenger in seat 46C that it looked like we might have a bit of extra space which was nice, but also said that if it remained empty would he object if my wife, who had been allocated a seat elsewhere, came and sat in it.  He said that would be fine and then added that he was convinced that it would be empty because when he had checked the online system just after it opened he had been automatically allocated that middle seat, and when he got to the airport he asked if he could change his seat and they did from 46B to 46C.  I then asked him why he hadn’t done that online the previous day and he said it would not let him. 

I concluded that all three of those seats could have automatically been allocated to us at the time Virgin do their automatic seat allocation, but instead they deliberately spread us around the cabin.  They also then did not allow us to change our automatically allocated seats when it would appear that we should have been able to do so. 

Because of this experience we reluctantly paid the extra to sit together on our return flight.

We were booked on flight BA43 from LHR to CPT departing 31/12/17 on booking reference 4M7G52.  Since it was New Year’s Eve we had paid for two seats together which we got and used.  Can’t find our seat numbers but we were in the right two seats of the 4 in the middle of a 747 roughly in the middle of the plane.  If the 10 seats left to right were say a,b,c - d,e,f,g - h, j, k  then we were in f & g. 

When we boarded we took our seats and all was fine.  It was a full flight with lots of families with young children/babies.  As I recall it the lady in seat (I assume) H had a small baby on her lap.  Her husband appeared to be in seat K and an independent passenger was in seat J.  I saw them having a discussion and the independent lady in seat J swapped with the man in seat K so that he and his wife and baby could all be together.  Everyone was happy.   I can only assume that the family had not paid in advance to sit apart and therefore had taken a gamble on being together which failed. I can also only assume that the single traveller had not paid in advance to select a middle of three seats - why would you!   So again it looks like BA had purposefully and unnecessarily separated the family with a baby to encourage then to pay to reserve a seat in the future.

We regularly fly BA and often use Avios points to do so but find it close to impossible to get anything other than economy seats and sometimes that is difficult.  I know the number is restricted etc and that is the reason given.   However I also know that on quite a few of these flights airline staff (past, present and related to) get free or very cheap seats mostly in classes superior to economy.  So my questions are i) why are the staff prioritised better than the customers, and ii) given that they benefit a better seat (they could have had mine) are they not receiving a taxable benefit which the HMRC should tax them on?

Obviously my point above applies where I had been a full fare paying passanger or an Avios paying passenger.

We were seated apart from each other, even though my partner had a completely empty seat next to her. And around us on the aircraft there were other empty seats. 

Last August we travelled back from Madrid, Ryanair again. We were sat apart again. We both had a window seat and my partner was sat in the row in front of me. Next to me were two gents, and their third friend was sat next to my partner with a spare seat.

Paid £68 for the party of 5 to be seated together. In September we selected our seat's together on the outward and return flights. The week prior to departure I went to online check in to discover that the airline had split the party by allocating my grandchild's mother and I to different seats away from the others. I reported this to the airline as I was unable to move the two of us back to the original seats. Tui advised that we should see if we could be moved back to the original seats on check-in at the airport. This was not possible at the airport as we where advised that seat allocations had already been made. This caused distress as we had expected to be seated together for what was a very expensive holiday and a one off experience with our grandson also we had paid extra in expectation of being seated together. Tui offered to pay for the two seat allocations that had been changed until I advised that thay had not met the terms of contract and they paid £34. No other compensation has been paid.

Brian Bonsall,bribus@btinternet.com,More than 2 years ago,2,0,0,0,"No, I/they didn’t",TUI Airways (previously Thomson Airways),,We wanted to sit together but it was too expensive to pay extra to do so,Not Answered,"I wrote to the CEO of Thomson on 2 Nov 2015 as follows:

Dear Mr Burling,
I am sorry to tell you that my view of Thomson has suffered a serious setback. I came away feeling the victim of sharp practice and manipulation for the sake of a few pounds in the Thomson coffers. I want you to think of this manipulative practice in terms of the damage it does to your image and customer relations. Is it really worth what you might gain financially?

Yesterday evening I went through the online check-in for flight TOM7260 from East Midlands to Tenerife South, just 36 hours before the scheduled flight time. I was presented with the cabin plan showing the two seats allocated to me and my partner. They were separated by the aisle. All other seats were shown as unavailable, apart from two pairs one on the starboard side and the other on the port side. When trying to select either pair I was presented with a charge of around £10 per seat. I felt I was being manipulated and pressured into paying for seats together, even at this late stage. Firstly, I felt I was being treated like a fool by being shown an apparently fully checked-in cabin plan with only 6 seats left, that is simply unbelievable! Secondly, I was deliberately allocated split seats when their were pairs available. The return flight had exactly the same cabin plan and seat allocation. This was an attempt to force a few extra pounds out of my pocket and into yours just so we could sit together. There comes a time when seats should be allocated fairly, even though the customer has not chosen to pay extra to select them. I have much experience with other airlines and have never before faced such sharp practice. Do you try the same trick at the check-in desk? 
From my reaction, you should be able to tell the damage it does to your image. Can you really afford to inflict such self harm? This practice is a further example of what is popularly known as ""Rip Off Britain"". In fact, I could possibly alert the BBC television programme to this experience.
I urge you to consider changing this practice for the sake of the Thomson image.

Yours sincerely,

Brian Bonsall

I also wrote to the CAA complaining of this dubious practice on 15 November 2015. Displaying a completely full cabin, apart from six available seats was false pretences. I have flown with Thomson about six times since and the story is always the same. I argued that their seating algorithm was deliberately designed to separate people who do not pay extra. With three seats either side of the aisle, statistically 66% of couples will naturally sit together. It requires a deliberate act to separate couples. I have been flying regularly for more than thirty years and it is only in recent times I have found it hard to sit with my partner without money being demanded. I am not alone in resenting this practice and it is certainly contradictory to good customer service.

I received a phone call from the CEOs office but it was full of excuses and obfuscation. I had my say but nothing changed. 

I am pleased to see that the CAA is investigating. I just hope the CAA has the will to act.

This is my letter to the CAA: 15 Nov 2015

From my recent experience,and what I see other people are saying, I would like to know which is the best body to bring pressure to bear on Thomson Airways to make it review its policy on seat allocation.
I have read the CAA guidelines in which it says ""passengers should not be required to pay extra for a particular seat"". I understand the difference between ""requiring"" and ""volunteering"". This means that giving passengers 90 days to choose to pay to prebook seats can be seen as a voluntary payment and not against your guidelines. Although Thomson's publicity and advice suggests the need to prebook, and pay extra, in order that couples, or families, can sit together. This, despite the fact that there is a 66% likelihood that couples will have to sit together, when there are 3 seats either side of the aisle anyway.
Where Thomson's policy and procedures become dubious is when it comes to the point, 7 days before departure, that online checkin opens. There is evidence to show that Thomson Airways computer program for seating allocation is programmed to allocate split seating in order to force ""voluntary"" payments out of passengers who require to sit together. So their publicity advising people to pay to sit together is reinforced by their computer program which deliberately separates couples when passengers have chosen not to pay. 
Just 36 hours before the departure time, I logged in to do online check in. I had chosen not to pay for seat allocation during the previous 90 days. I was staggered to be confronted with a cabin plan showing two seats allocated to me on either side of the aisle and only 4 other available seats in pairs on either side of the aircraft. Exactly the same cabin plan was displayed for the return journey two weeks later, which I found too much a coincidence to be believable. On clicking on either of the available pairs of seats a pop-up showed the additional charge of £9.50 per seat. I felt this to be misrepresentation and deception, in an attempt to force me to pay extra for available seats. In addition, I found that at least 20% of passengers still check in at the desk; by my asking a check in clerk. So on our flight of 189 seats there were 21 spare seats anyway and at least 38 still to check in at the desk plus others who would have done online check in after me This means I was shown a fictitious cabin plan when I did online check in. There would have been at least 60 seats still unallocated, not just 6!
I would like to see Thomson's made to change their policy, so that 7 days before departure they give up further attempts at manipulating their customers. They should be made to show true cabin plans with true  availability of seats and freedom for customers to select seats from those remaining, with no further attempt to extract extra charges by misrepresentation and manipulation. This evidently is contrary to your guidelines. I have a feeling that their current practice of displaying a false cabin plan is misrepresentation and borders on the fraudulent. It would surely attract a severe reprimand if attempted by most retail traders.
I have written to the CEO of Thomson Airways, who gave my letter to one if his staff who gave me a reply which did nothing to show they understood, or wanted to understand, the serious issue I raise. Hence, I am writing to you.

Brian Bonsall

Graham Bowser,gb@bowsermail.co.uk,Within the last month,2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",British Airways (BA),,We did not all sit together despite paying extra to do so,£30 or more,"BA took our money to  ensure that we sat together (and have so far refused to refund it) despite them forcing the cancellation of the flight.

 A week before travelling I found that they had changed our connecting flight (2 leg journey) to 3 hours BEFORE we would arrive at the intermediate airport (ANU).  They refused to arrange an alternate ongoing flight  on the same day or the following days leaving me to sort out the mess - the only options they gave  being 

1.to make our own alternate arrangements  for our onward travel and accept a refund of 'that leg only' PROVIDED THAT we completed the rest of the booking (i.e. the FULL return leg from Tortola -EIS to ANU & LGW) as per the booking. 

2.Cancel the booking in full and have a refund for the flight cost. 

I had no choice  but to cancel and am still awaiting my refund for that

The replies I have had so far re asking for a refund of the seat payments for the trip are that they wont pay because I cancelled the flight. Apparently the microseconds of administration their computer took to allocate the seats and collect my money is a cost they need to recover and the fact that they forced the cancellation is irrelevant!

It is more or less accepted by us customers that when dealing with many airlines it really is a caveat emptor situation where they will rip you off for extra money wherever they can. This though is the worst example of lack of customer care I have ever experienced in 40 years of travelling.

Garner,garnerg51@icloud.com,"More than 1 month ago, but within the last 3 months",2,,,,"No, I/they didn’t",Ryanair,,We wanted to sit together but it was too expensive to pay extra to do so,Not Answered,"For the last 10 years we have flown with Ryanair (London Stansted to Alicante), approx 5 times a year.  Up until May 2017 we always sat together even though we did not purchase seats. (Until then, it seemed to be Ryanair's policy to sit you together although they could not guarantee it, when you had a free seat allocation.)
On our last flight in December, we were allocated seats 5E and 17B.

From May 2017 we found that Ryanair allocated you two seats that were not together, but offered to change then for a fee (£6 -£17) if you wanted to sit together.
Also Ryanair had reduce the time before flying that you could checkin for a free seat, down to 4 days in advance of the flight.

On checking in for the subsequent 5 flights since then, I have checked seat availability (for free checkin) from from the four days down to the day before the flight. I have seen that even when there are several complete rows of seats available we have been separated each time. Also the Centre seats of complete rows are allocated first, which then ensures the last people to check in are always seperated. 

We have seen other groups separated: 
ie.  Families with two year old child separated, with Mother on the front row and Father and child back in the 30 rows.
Person with a physical disability would have been separated from the rest of the family, but for other passengers agreeing to swap seats to enable them to be together. 

I emailed Ryanair customer service in 13th July last year and had the following response. 

""In relation to your recent correspondence we inform you that, we haven’t changed the random seat allocation policy. More and more of our passengers are taking our reserved seats (from just £2) and these passengers overwhelmingly prefer aisle and window seats which is why people who choose random (free of charge) seats are more likely to be allocated middle seats.

The reason of the appearance of empty seats is that these are more likely to be selected by reserved seat passengers, many of whom only check-in 24 hours prior to departure. Since our current load factor is 95%, we have to keep these window and aisle seats free to facilitate those customers who are willing to pay for them.

This is entirely a matter of customer choice. We are not trying to force people to pay for reserved seats. We are very happy to facilitate any customer who wants a free of charge random seat but at the same time, we do our best to facilitate customers who are willing to pay for a reserved seat.

Please accept our renewed apologies for the inconvenience encountered on this occasion.""

I do have to ask why they can do this? I would be interested to know how many restaurants you know that charge for customers to sit together? The charge should be part of the ticket price not an extra at the end of the booking process. Charge yes for extra leg room but charging for a standard seat when no service is being provided is appalling. Is £50 for seats a fair cost for booking when the customer actually does the booking.
Another point I wish to make is Jet2 charge if you do not check in online. You do this and as part of this process you have to pay to book the seats. So you are forced to make an additional payment. Also an extra payment is demanded to guarantee that hand luggage goes into the plane and not the hold. It is an absolute scandal and Jet2 can not be bothered to repond to my complaint

We noticed that sets of seats together were appearing to be rapidly becoming unavailable, so we were effectively forced to purchase seats in advance in order to avoid being split up and seated apart, or to be left with no aisle access between us. At the time of booking our seats there were apparently only 8 seats together that included one aisle seat, and a further 6 central seats available. 
Furthermore, the seat purchase webpage was not functioning properly: we were able to book the set of two seats that were acceptable to us, but not to pay. We had to conclude the transaction by phoning BA passenger services on a 0344 line. 
We consider that BA's policy on advance seat booking is tantamount to extortion. We had to pay £38 per seat on our outbound flight and £43 per seat on our return flight, for a total of £162.00.   On top of already paying £500 for each of the return tickets in this premium economy class. Furthermore it is not clear whether or not the ""unavailable"" seats have genuinely been purchased, or whether BA is using an AI algorithm to make it appear that window and aisle seats are being avidly gobbled up at £49-38 by real passengers, when they are actually being withheld in order to blackmail customers into paying the extra.

I complained and they allocated me free seats together for the flight out but not for the return journey because I was unable to check in until I was away.  Ryanair have also reduced the check-in period to four days unless you have paid a premium.  This means one is often unable to checkin at home for the return journey and print boarding passes.

Elin Llywelyn Williams,elagar35@gmail.com,Within the last month,1,,,,"Yes, I/they did",British Airways (BA),,None of these,£30 or more,"I live with anxiety and claustrophobia which derive from a phobia I have - emetophobia. It is a fear of vomiting or seeing or hearing others vomiting. I have undergone treatment for my phobia and it has taken me a long time to get to the point where I can travel in a confined environent. Having already upgraded to Premium Economy to sit in a cabin with fewer peopleI then paid £106.00 to British Airways to secure a window seat for myself and an isle seat for my husband. I will not travel without securing such seats as sitting in the usual row of 3 is simply out of the question. These seats are as important to me as the holiday itself. I received proof of purchase and an aircraft plan with our window and isle seat highlighted. Although I have a fear of flying (as a result of my phobia), knowing that we have these seats before flying puts my mind at ease. However, as I embarked the aircraft on a flight from Newark to London, I discovered that these seats had now been allocated to another couple and our seats were now in the middle of a row of 4. I was absolutely mortified and was so distressed that I was led off the aircraft by a kind attendant. The male BA worker at the gate told me that I would need to 'get bach on that plane or catch a later flight'. As my husband was on the plane, I had no choice but to return. I was in tears and feeling very unwell. How could they have changed our window and isle seat (row of 2) to seats in the middle of a row of 4? I would never have travelled or even gone on holiday had I been notified of this in good time. I paid for specific seats for very, very good reasons and my purchase had been completely ignored. When people pay that amount of money simply to select seats, there is usually a good reason for it. Changing our seats to seats I would never have purchased without even a mention of an apology or refund is inexcusable. It caused great distress to myself. I was later moved to an isle seat which helped with my claustrophobia but my husband and I were then seated apart. I struggle to understand how a well-respected company can justify this. How can they offer a service, take their customer's money and then not deliver on this service. I am appalled. I would appreciate any advice before I proceed further with my complaint.

What I find outrageous is that in the sitting plan of the plane there were empty seats just next to the ones that we'd both been assigned: we could have been assigned a seat next to each other in the first place, without having to pay extra! It was very clear that the algorithm assigned separate seats on purpose, in spite of empty seats all around, to push passengers to pay extra to seat together. Once on the plane this was confirmed because several other passengers were in our same position, having been separated at online check-in, and sitting 10 or more rows apart. I was incensed, very annoying practice from Ryanair. On the return flight it happened again, we were assigned separate seats 10 rows apart (although there were plenty of empty seats all around), my girlfriend didn't want to sit on her own so we gave in and decided to pay extra to sit together.

My wife and I have a 7 year old grandson whose mother died at the end of 2012. In the summer of 2014 and 2015 we took our grandson on American from MAN to LAX via ORD to spend time with our daughter and her husband in Ventura,CA and in 2016 we booked flights for 23 July 2016 to LAX on 12 May 2016. I complained on 15 May 2016 to AA because I was extremely disappointed that the presentation of seat availability by AA appears to disadvantage families. Clearly with a 7 year old grandson to entertain on flights across the Atlantic and to the West Coast it is essential for my wife and I to sit next to our grandson. When booking 10 weeks before the flight it was not possible to select three seats together on AA55 without paying an extra £252 for 3 Main Cabin Extra seats. For whatever reason, the seats which do not require a premium payment are in rows 14 to 17 and rows 21 to 28 on 15 May 16, when I complained, 20 seats were still shown as available. Of these 20 seats, 17 were the middle seat of a block of three, with 2 aisle seats and 1 window seat available. 17 blocks of 3 seats were showing no availability. 33 seats had been allocated to people who had not chosen to sit next to a companion or fellow traveller (or were reserved for Elite travellers). When I booked there were therefore at least 23 available seats not requiring a premium payment, and yet our party of 3 people (2 grandparents and a grandson) could only get 2 seats together seats 21E & 21H with a further seat behind at 22D. I regard this arrangement as unacceptable for a flight time exceeding 7 hours, but I also consider the extra payment of £252 equally unacceptable. If middle seats are regarded as so inferior there should be a compensation for using them. With the current allocation system, families with children are at a serious disadvantage because middle seats are being avoided rigorously by singles. In the 36 sets of 3 seats, there could be no more than 17 sets of 3 people. We should have been the 18th and yet it had not been possible.

AA replied on 16 May 16 with some suggestions which proved unsuccessful because they have actually designed the system to be like it is. I replied on 17 May 16 including the following ""I accept that a single traveller preferring an aisle seat or a window seat may be important to those individuals, but to me the need to be available next to one’s 7 year old grandson during a 7 hour flight ranks above whether a single traveller sits in exactly the seat he chooses, particularly when it is at the cost of three other travellers who are having their choice denied. If someone really insists on an aisle seat or a window seat, I do not see why AA should give that person the opportunity to break into an empty set of 3 seats, when single aisle seats or single window seats are still available in nearby rows, as is the case here, and in my opinion these should be booked up first by the single travellers, until it is really necessary to break into a new empty set of 3 seats.""

AA replied on 17 May 16 with a suggestion which was unsuccessful and I wrote a further e-mail on 18 May 16 with the following ""Thank you for your reply. I have contacted AA reservations as you suggested. Unfortunately they are unable to help other than by allocating 3 main cabin extra seats at a total cost of £252.90, which is unacceptable to us. They did say that the premium cost can vary with time and that some seats are blocked for the airport staff to unblock during the check-in process, within 24 hours of the flight. This does nothing for our anxiety about the flight over the next 9 weeks, but clarifies our understanding of AA’s lack concern for families travelling with children, no matter how regularly they fly.""

The flight in question went ahead on 23 July 2016 and I wrote to AA on 27 August 2016 including the following ""I therefore was in the unfortunate situation of spending the whole flight of over 7 hours on a different row to my 7 year old mother-less grandson, whose welfare was left to my 69 year old wife and we regarded the experience as completely unsatisfactory, and a lost opportunity for me to help my wife and spend time with my grandson.Despite this being our 13th year on American,regularly visiting our daughter in the US,sometimes with a party of up to 6 people,we have now concluded that AA do not look after families with young children and do not want our business.
To add to what I have already said in my earlier complaint:The assignment of seats allows single travellers to pick one of a set of 3 unassigned seats, when a similar seat is still available nearby in a row with another seat already assigned. This is unreasonable and unfair to 3 people who wish to sit together.Couples also have a habit of reserving an aisle seat and a window seat,with an unassigned 'middle' seat between them,in the hope of it being untaken.We saw an example of this on AA1576 on 7 Aug(see complaint re that flight for detail).AA could stop both of these problems at the seat assignment stage.Thirdly AA could stop blocking to us 6 seats per row in rows 14 to 17.If the couple in 21C&D had been reassigned by AA to 22C&D,and the single in 22C to 21C, I(22D)could have been moved to 21D to join my family!""

Since this experience in July 2016 we have visited our daughter in California with our UK grandson on 3 further occasions via LAX with another planned trip at Easter 2018. We have not purchased an AA flight since the July 2016 trip. We have never paid a premium to BA for seat allocation.

AA Elite travellers can reserve seats at a discount, but over the years AA have made the qualification for Elite levels more difficult to achieve, and they now offer an annual opportunity to purchase Gold status for a year for a cost of 1249$, which I regard as excessive.  AA's high charges for reserving seats only become evident towards the end of selecting an itinerary in the booking process. This makes the decision making process extremely complex and extended; the only efficient way of booking a flight is not to bother considering American Airlines, unless you are travelling as a single.
